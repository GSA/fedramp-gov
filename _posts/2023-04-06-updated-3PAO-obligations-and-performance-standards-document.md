The FedRAMP PMO, in coordination with the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), has made several revisions to the <a href="https://demo.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/3PAO_Obligations_and_Performance_Standards.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) Obligations and Performance Standards document</a> that focus on further defining the program’s 3PAO performance and compliance expectations. 

The updates include:
- Ensuring 3PAO compliance with the requirements set forth in the FedRAMP Authorization Act, including Section 3612. Declaration of foreign interests 
- Ensuring 3PAO adherence to personnel requirements regarding years of experience, training, certification qualifications, and technical proficiency activities outlined in the "<a href="https://a2la.qualtraxcloud.com/ShowDocument.aspx?ID=5621" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A2LA R311 – Specific Requirements: Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</a>" document
- Defining ramifications for all stakeholder deliverables submitted by 3PAO teams who do not meet the personnel requirements, as maintained in the Baltimore Cyber Range (BCR) 3PAO Personnel Database
- Notifying all relevant stakeholders when the performance of their 3PAO is being reviewed by the FedRAMP PMO
- Defining conditions for re-entry into the FedRAMP 3PAO program following a 3PAO’s revocation 
- Updating the “3PAO/A2LA/FedRAMP PMO Roles and Responsibilities” reference table (formerly the “3PAO JAB P-ATO Roles and Responsibilities” standalone document)
