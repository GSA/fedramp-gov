FedRAMP is releasing baselines for public comment, and we want your feedback. 

<strong>Rev 5 Baselines</strong>

FedRAMP uses the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) guidelines and procedures to provide standardized security requirements for cloud services. Specifically, FedRAMP leverages NIST’s Special Publication [SP] 800-53 - <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final" target="_blank">Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations series</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-sm"></i>, the baselines and test cases.

In 2020, NIST released SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, Revision 5 (Rev. 5) catalog of security and privacy controls and SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations. The FedRAMP PMO worked with the Joint Advisory Board to develop the FedRAMP baselines in alignment with NIST’s Rev. 5 update.

<strong>Applying Threat-Based Methodology to Rev 5 Baselines</strong>

Using the Threat-Based Methodology, FedRAMP analyzed each NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 control within the FedRAMP High baseline on their ability to protect, detect, and/or respond to each of the techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework version 8.2. FedRAMP applied the threat-based methodology to evaluate the controls FedRAMP adds above the published NIST Rev. 5 baseline. 

By applying this methodology, FedRAMP significantly reduced the number of controls added by FedRAMP in addition to the NIST Rev. 5 baselines.  
- Low baseline - FedRAMP added 1 additional control (above the NIST baseline) 
- Moderate baseline - FedRAMP added 17 additional controls (above the NIST baseline)
- High baseline -  FedRAMP added 22 additional controls (above the NIST baseline)

Each of these additional controls scored high enough in the threat scoring to retain in the FedRAMP baselines. Despite a significant increase in NIST baseline controls, FedRAMP was able to decrease the number of Moderate and High controls by leveraging threat scoring.

<strong>We Want Your Feedback!</strong>

FedRAMP anticipates that more strategic control selection will result in a more focused security authorization process. The FedRAMP PMO is releasing this initial draft of the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Security_Controls_Baseline_Rev_5_Public_Comment_2021_12_20.xlsx">FedRAMP Rev. 5 baselines for public comment</a>. Your feedback is critical in continuing to provide the best guidance possible.
