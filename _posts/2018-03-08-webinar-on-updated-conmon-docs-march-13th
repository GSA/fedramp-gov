Building upon ear
**Best Practices**

Earlier this year, we released the updated continuous monitoring (ConMon) documents with the goal of: 

Improving the overall process and clarify certain elements or expectations
Making it easier to reference aspects of the process that previously were not documented
Creating structure in parts of the process that may have been interpreted differently by CSPs and JAB Reviewers

Details outlining these can be found on our blog, posted on January 31st.

On March 13th, from 1-2 pm ET, FedRAMP will be holding a webinar that will provide an overview of the updates made to FedRAMP’s ConMon documents, including both updates to existing documents and new documents. These documents include:

**Completed Documents**
1. Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide
2. Continuous Monitoring Performance Management Guide
3. Vulnerability Deviation Request Form
4. Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) Template Completion Guide
5. Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) Template
6. Significant Change Form Template
7. Digital Identity Requirements
8. Transport Layer Security (TLS) Requirements
9. Continuous Monitoring Monthly Exchange Executive Summary

**Documents that Will be Completed Soon**
