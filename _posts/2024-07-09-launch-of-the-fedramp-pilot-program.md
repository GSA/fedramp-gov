Today, FedRAMP is launching a new pilot program to improve program effectiveness and address key challenges for our stakeholders. The pilot program will approach improvements in an agile way: through iterative development and release cycles, stakeholder engagement, and iterative improvements based on lessons learned.

Our first pilot effort will be on a new non-blocking process for reviewing significant changes for new feature additions to existing cloud service offerings (CSOs). As we discussed in our  <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-03-28-a-new-roadmap-for-fedramp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap release</a>, the goal is to eventually replace the current “significant change request” process with an approach that does not require advance approval for each change. We’re piloting this approach because we believe the same security outcomes can be achieved by an alternative approach that empowers cloud providers to continuously deliver and assess improvements using secure and agile delivery and deployment practices.

<h4>Kicking off with the Agile Delivery pilot</h4>
We have received remarkable interest and excitement around participating in pilots, and we are kicking off with our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/agile-delivery-pilot-non-blocking-change-request-phase1/">Agile Delivery pilot focused on new features</a>. The data gathered from this pilot will help inform program-wide changes to streamline the current change and configuration management processes and shift towards continuous assessment.

Currently, cloud service providers (CSPs) must go through independent testing and agency approval before rolling out a new feature. This could result in negative impacts and opportunity costs, including to the overall security offering of authorized cloud providers:
  1. Agencies see significant delays before getting access to features – including security features – that can help them deliver on their mission.
  2. CSPs may create government-specific offerings, or elect not to enter the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> at all, so as not to delay the development and improvement of their core offerings.

The Agile Delivery new feature pilot intends to ensure that agencies can leverage the latest features and services while removing the roadblocks for CSPs to bring these features to market.

<h4>Agile Delivery pilot prerequisites</h4>
CSPs who have a new feature they plan to release before December 31, 2024, are encouraged to apply. CSPs should have mature automated configuration management and change management processes, whose details they are willing to share with FedRAMP.

FedRAMP will work with the CSP and their authorizing official (AO) to determine participation, targeting around 20 participants with different approaches. Pilot participants must continue to inform agencies of the changes, provide self-assessment artifacts, and undergo independent testing by January 31, 2024. 

To limit the scope and potential impact of changes to agencies, new features launched as part of this pilot must be opt-in. Opt-in features should not be required for the rest of the offering to function, and agency customers must proactively decide to use that service or feature. Additionally, changes to the underlying architecture or new security control implementations for the entire offering will be excluded from the pilot. To summarize, for the purposes of this pilot, agencies must choose to use the new feature and the new feature cannot change the:
- system’s fundamental architecture, 
- types of components used such as databases, operating systems, or containers, and 
- tooling used to configure, secure, and scan those components. 

Please visit our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/fedramp-pilots/">pilot program web page</a> for more information on how to apply. FedRAMP will accept applications from now through July 26, 2024, and will work with the CSP and agencies to make selections by August 16, 2024.
