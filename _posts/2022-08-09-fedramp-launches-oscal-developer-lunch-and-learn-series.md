FedRAMP is excited to launch an Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) Developer Lunch & Learn series! We invite OSCAL users from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), federal agencies, and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) to join us for a virtual lunch & learn and take part in discussions with our FedRAMP OSCAL team. 

<h4>What</h4>
The series will cover a variety of technical topics regarding users’ utilization of OSCAL for FedRAMP, FedRAMP automation updates or changes, and open forum conversations with subject matter experts. 

<h4>When</h4>
The first OSCAL Developers Lunch & Learn will be held on <b>Thursday, September 1, at 12:00pm EDT</b>. The series will continue on a bi-weekly basis.

<h4>Who</h4>
All OSCAL users including CSPs, federal agencies, and 3PAOs

<h4>How Will The Lunch & Learns Work?</h4>
Following the introduction and welcome to each meeting, the FedRAMP OSCAL Lunch & Learns will be divided into three main sections:
- FedRAMP’s technical experts will <b>provide information on any updates or changes</b> to FedRAMP’s OSCAL usage.
- FedRAMP’s technical experts will <b>address questions</b> submitted by participants prior to the meeting. Those interested may submit questions ahead of the next session and/or requests to have specific topics covered in future meetings by filling out <a href="https://forms.gle/7vER3W3pRbR1wq6R9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a>.
- The remainder of the meeting will be an <b>open discussion</b> to allow participants to <b>engage directly with and ask questions of the team</b> working on FedRAMP automation via OSCAL.

<h4>Why is FedRAMP hosting these sessions?</h4>
Our goal is to establish and maintain regular communication with our OSCAL end-users to ensure we are addressing the needs of all stakeholders involved.
