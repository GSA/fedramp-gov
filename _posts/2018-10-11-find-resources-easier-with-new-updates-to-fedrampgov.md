The FedRAMP PMO is excited to share some new updates to the website. In response to customer feedback and website analytics, we’ve updated the side bars on the Partners We Serve pages to include “action boxes” that bring visitors to specific resource pages. These new pages provide information about the FedRAMP related action and consolidates all the relevant resources in one place for easy reference. 

For example, on the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/cloud-service-providers/">Cloud Service Provider page</a> you will see an “action box” on the right hand side that says <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/pursuing-a-fedramp-tailored-authorization/"> Pursuing a FedRAMP Tailored Authorization</a>. On this page CSPs are able to read a short overview of what a Tailored Authorization is, download all the documents and templates required for Tailored, and review blogs related to the topic. 

These updates are intended to make FedRAMP resources easier and quicker to find. Over the course of the last year, our website analytics have indicated that the Partners We Serve pages are the most visited pages on the site. We provided this addition to those pages to also help people newer to the program understand the actions related to FedRAMP and the information available to guide them through the process. 

Over the next month we will hold three webinars to go over the different actions related to each partner group (CSPs, Agencies, and 3PAOs) and what the resources on the new pages are. Be on the lookout for invites to these different webinars from info@fedramp.gov. As this is an iterative process, we’ll be asking for your feedback post-webinars].

We are committed to listening to our customers and enhancing our services to best serve your needs. As always, if you have any questions, please reach out to info@fedramp.gov
