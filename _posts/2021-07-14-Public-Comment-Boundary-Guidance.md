FedRAMP recognizes the importance of the FedRAMP Authorization Boundary Guidance in supporting the development of security package documentation for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). 

The FedRAMP Authorization Boundary Guidance was initially created, in collaboration with both internal and external stakeholders and the Joint Authorization Board (JAB), to help CSPs understand how to accurately describe and illustrate their Cloud Service Offering’s (CSO’s) authorization boundary. This latest update provides CSPs with more detail and clarity on how to describe and illustrate their CSO’s authorization boundary, data flow diagrams, and network interconnections.  

The FedRAMP PMO is releasing this <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/documents/CSP_A_FedRAMP_Authorization_Boundary_Guidance.pdf" target="_blank">initial draft of the FedRAMP Authorization Boundary Guidance</a> for public comment. Your feedback is critical in continuing to provide the best guidance possible.
