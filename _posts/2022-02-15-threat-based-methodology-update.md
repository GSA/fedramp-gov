FedRAMP updated the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Threat-Based_Risk_Profiling_Methodology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Threat-Based Methodology White Paper</a> to reflect changes to our methodology behind the threat-based scoring approach and its potential applications. FedRAMP is also excited to share the accompanying dataset, located on our github repository [insert link].  We encourage you to read the white paper and data set and provide feedback and/or questions to <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>. The FedRAMP PMO looks forward to receiving your comments and sharing progress.

<h4>Recap of Threat-Based White Paper</h4> 

In February 2021, FedRAMP released the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Threat-Based_Risk_Profiling_Methodology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Threat-Based Methodology White Paper</a> to solicit feedback and promote the adoption of a threat-based model. The goal of this model is to enable agencies, Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), and other industry partners to prioritize security controls that are most relevant and effective against the current threat environment. FedRAMP anticipates this model will lead to informed, quantitative-based risk management decisions in authorizing information systems for government use.

<h4>Update to Methodology: FedRAMP Scores Against the MITRE ATT&CK Framework Version 8.2</h4> 

Later in 2021, FedRAMP conducted a second round of scoring efforts in order <b>to align the Threat-Based Approach to the MITRE ATT&CK threat framework version 8.2 </b>. FedRAMP’s previous scoring was done using the NSA/CSS Technical Cyber Threat Framework (NTCTF), which was recently discontinued. To align with MITRE ATT&CK threat framework, FedRAMP analyzed each NIST SP 800-53, rev. 5 control within the FedRAMP High baseline on their ability to protect, detect, and/or respond to each of the techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework version 8.2.  The Threat-Based White Paper reflects this update to scoring methodologies.

<h4>Feasibility Study: Agile Approach to Authorizations</h4> 

In 2017, the Office of American Innovation (OAI) sponsored a feasibility study, coordinated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and managed by the General Services Administration (GSA) FedRAMP PMO. 
The study’s objective was to determine whether  a modular approach to authorizations would work. The study determined that an agile approach to authorizations would work if it established a defensible methodology to prioritize controls. 

<h4>FedRAMP’s Threat-Based Methodology</h4>

FedRAMP needed to determine which security controls and capabilities are most effective to protect, detect, and respond to current prevalent threats. FedRAMP worked with DHS’s Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency .gov Cybersecurity Architecture Review (CISA’s .govCAR). They developed a methodology for scoring each NIST SP 800-53, rev. 4, security control against the National Security Agency’s (NSA)/CSS Technical Cyber Threat Framework v2 (NTCTF). Their goal is to enable agencies, Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), and other industry partners to prioritize security controls that are relevant and effective against the current threat environment. This leads to informed, quantitative-based risk management decisions in authorizing information systems for government use.

<h4>Our Ask of You: Provide Feedback on Our Methodology White Paper</h4>

FedRAMP developed a <a href="https://fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Threat-Based_Risk_Profiling_Methodology.pdf">white paper</a> that outlines the methodology behind the threat-based scoring approach and its potential applications. We encourage you to read this white paper and provide feedback / questions to <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>. The FedRAMP PMO looks forward to receiving your comments and sharing progress.
