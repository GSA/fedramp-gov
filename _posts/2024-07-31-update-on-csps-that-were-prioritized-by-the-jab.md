Last month, we <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-06-04-fedramp-governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared information</a> about the establishment of the FedRAMP Board, which is our new governance body responsible for reviewing and approving FedRAMP policies, and for bringing together their fellow federal technology leaders to expand FedRAMP’s capacity for authorizing cloud services. The FedRAMP Board replaces the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and with that, many of our customers have asked questions about what that means for vendors who have been working with the JAB.

Today we are providing an update related to the cloud services who were either queued or prioritized to work with the JAB. Due to the transition away from the JAB as the governing body, government work was paused until a suitable transition could be determined.

We want our stakeholders to know that FedRAMP is continuing to work with all cloud services that were in queue or prioritized by the JAB, and who are still pursuing authorization and not yet authorized, to find the best path forward given the transition happening with FedRAMP right now. 

We are approaching this in the following way:
- <b>Authorizations by one or more agencies:</b> CSPs who were prioritized by the JAB and have an agency customer focused on using the product quickly, or CSPs who have multiple customers willing to work together on an authorization.
- <b>Authorizations by the FedRAMP program:</b> FedRAMP will issue authorizations directly, without an agency sponsor, for CSPs who do not fit the other path at this time. This is a new path to authorization, and is called a “program authorization”. It is important to note that this is not a path that is generally open yet to CSPs, as we have not yet determined what criteria or approach we will use to select CSPs for it going forward. However, we are performing these initial program authorizations to ensure that CSPs who were prioritized by the JAB have an opportunity to get through the authorization process.

We also want it to be understood that CSPs whose authorization process has been visibly paused did not do anything “wrong”, but were caught in the transition process. Additionally, agencies who are interested in helping to expedite the authorization process for these CSPs can come to the table to participate in joint authorizations of these products.
