The FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board has approved the FedRAMP Rev. 5 baselines! The FedRAMP baselines were updated to correspond with the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Rev. 5 Catalog of Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations</a> and <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53b/final" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SP 800-53B Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations</a>. 

During the approval process, FedRAMP has been working diligently to complete updates based on public comments to the Rev. 5 baselines and supporting documentation, including Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) versions. Due to the extensive updates required, the documentation will be released in a phased approach, starting with:

<h3>CSP Transition Plan</h3> 
- General information/summary 

<h3>Rev. 5 Baselines<h3>
- Aligned security controls more closely with NIST (smaller delta between NIST and FedRAMP baselines compared to Rev. 4)
- Added no new controls to the baseline from Rev. 4 outside of the new controls from NIST baselines (i.e. supply chain risk management)
- Privacy controls (and any other control outside of the FedRAMP baselines) are still at the Agency’s discretion
- PM controls are inherently an Agency responsibility and are therefore not included in the baselines
-  Added significant guidance for many controls based on collaboration with stakeholders

<h3>Rev. 4 To Rev. 5 Baseline Summary</h3>
- Summary of the control changes from Rev. 4 to Rev. 5.

<h2>What's Next?</h2> 
The remaining Rev. 5 templates will be released within the next few weeks which will include: 
- System Security Plan (SSP)
- Security Assessment Plan (SAP)
- Security Assessment Report (SAR)
- Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) for high, moderate, low, and Li-SaaS baselines, along with their corresponding OSCAL guides 

FedRAMP will also provide training and educational forums specific to the Rev. 5 updates and the transition process early this summer. 

In the meantime, we ask that cloud service providers and other stakeholders review and understand the expectations and requirements in the CSP Transition Plan and make plans for addressing the first wave of templates to be released.
