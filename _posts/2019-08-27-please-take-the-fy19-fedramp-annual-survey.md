The FedRAMP PMO is seeking your feedback and released the <a href="https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_a909oTEezNr3zFj">FedRAMP Annual Survey</a>. If you’ve interacted with FedRAMP at any point in the last year, please take a few minutes to respond to the survey by **September 24th.** 
The team will use the information gathered from the survey as a pulse check to gauge how we’re doing and to inform future program initiatives. 
Thank you in advance for your participation and insight.
