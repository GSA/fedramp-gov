The FedRAMP PMO is proud to release the [Agency Authorization Playbook](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2017/11/FRP-0002_Agency-Playbook_FINAL-1.pdf)!

Through our work revamping the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) process, we identified a number of best practices and tips that will help Agencies as they work with Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to grant initial Agency authorizations. We developed the Agency Authorization Playbook by combining these best practices and tips with step-by-step guidance that Agencies can follow to implement the process (depicted below) to grant an Agency Authority to Operate (ATO).

The Playbook provides information on how to effectively work with the FedRAMP PMO and CSPs in the process and identifies all of the roles and responsibilities, and FedRAMP resources and templates involved at the various milestones throughout the process. We hope this will help promote transparency and set consistent expectations for all involved.

As always, if you have any questions about granting an Agency ATO, please reach out to us at [info@fedramp.gov](mailto:info@fedramp.gov).
