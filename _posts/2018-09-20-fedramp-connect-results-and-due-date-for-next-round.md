Over the last two months we completed the latest round of FedRAMP Connect where Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are prioritized to work with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB). In order to prioritize the right CSPs, the FedRAMP PMO reviews each business case submitted by CSPs interested in pursuing a JAB authorization and analyzes their current and potential demand. The focus of this process is to choose the CSPs that offer services that will benefit the widest variety of Agencies across the Federal Government.

We are delighted to announce the next round of vendors that have been prioritized by the JAB: 

 * Adobe Systems, Inc. 
 * Lookout, Inc. 
 * Smartsheet, Inc. 
 * Zscaler, Inc. 

**As we communicated in our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/fedramp-connect-new-guidance-on-jab-prioritization-and-submitting-a-business-case/">FedRAMP Connect blog post</a> earlier this summer and in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/documents/CSP_JAB_P-ATO_Prioritization_Criteria_and_Guidance.pdf">JAB Prioritization Criteria and Guidance</a> document, we are now accepting business cases on a rolling basis and will have cut off dates quarterly. Our next cut off date for FedRAMP Connect business cases will be November 9th.** 

All vendors who participated in the last round of FedRAMP Connect and had proven demand will automatically be considered in subsequent rounds. As always, the PMO is also available for informational and coaching call to help CSPs prepare for FedRAMP Connect. If you have any questions or would like to set up a phone call, please e-mail info@fedramp.gov for more information.

We are excited to work with these prioritized vendors in the coming months and look forward to receiving more FedRAMP Connect business cases in November!
