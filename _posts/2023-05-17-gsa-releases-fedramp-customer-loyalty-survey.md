<h3>We want to hear from you!</h3> 
In previous years, the FedRAMP PMO released its own survey to our stakeholders. This year we are leveraging the existing annual GSA Customer Loyalty Survey to gather your valuable feedback. This is in an effort to be more efficient and to dedicate more resources to FedRAMP Automation activities. 

Please take a moment to complete this survey before <b>June 23, 2023</b> to share your feedback with the FedRAMP PMO. Be on the lookout for an email from <u><b>surveys@research.gsa.gov</b> titled <b></u>“'How are we doing? Let us know!”</b> The survey should take around 5 minutes to complete.

<h3>What is the impact of this survey?</h3>
Collecting customer feedback is essential for FedRAMP to align operations to customer needs. We are continuously looking for ways to improve our customer’s experience and provide stakeholders with the tools and services needed to be successful. 

We want your feedback on what we are doing well and what areas need improvement. The survey results will help FedRAMP to identify program changes and enhancements that better serve our customers. We value your insight and thank you in advance for your participation.
