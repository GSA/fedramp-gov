On Monday, October 30, the White House issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Executive Order (EO) on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence</a> , which will support an array of work across the federal government. To advance the objectives of the AI EO, FedRAMP will establish strategies for authorizing emerging technologies, including cloud-based AI-related products, ensuring agencies have the tools they need to more effectively serve the public.

In collaboration with stakeholders from the commercial and federal space, FedRAMP is conducting an analysis to determine the impact to security controls with the introduction of AI systems into a FedRAMP authorized system boundary. We will also spearhead collaboration with the FedRAMP Board, the Office of Management & Budget, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Federal Secure Cloud Advisory Committee to create and gain consensus on the authorization strategy for emerging technologies.

FedRAMP will communicate the details of the finalized framework through a series of FAQs, blogs, and forums to educate and train the community.

We look forward to partnering with our stakeholders on this important endeavor as we set the standard for whatâ€™s possible through AI and emerging technologies.
