FedRAMP often receives requests for information and guidance regarding the Agency Authorization process. In response, the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) is releasing a three part blog series that explores the formal touchpoints with stakeholders as they pursue a FedRAMP Authorization. Throughout this series we will explore the <b>What, Who, Why, and When</> of the following touchpoints:
- The Intake Call, 
- The Kickoff meeting, and 
- The Security Assessment Report (SAR) Debrief meeting
  
This first edition takes a look at <b>FedRAMP Intake Calls</>. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are highly encouraged to schedule these calls as their <u>first step</u> towards authorizing their Cloud Service Offering (CSO). 

<h4>What is an Intake Call?</h4> 
The Intake Call is a virtual, 30-minute call held to discuss the specifics of a CSO’s FedRAMP Authorization. 

<h4>Who is involved?</h4> 
Intakes are typically only attended by the PMO and CSPs, but other stakeholders can be invited at the CSPs discretion.

<h4>Why are Intake Calls important?</h4> 
These meetings provide an open forum for CSPs to ask questions and air their questions and concerns about the authorization process. It also allows the PMO to learn more about your system and provide appropriate guidance.

<h4>When should a call be scheduled?</h4>
Calls ideally occur as early in the authorization process as possible. However, they should only be scheduled after the CSP completes the following:
- The <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScU4_x5UK53d0PUUDsOdqWyzUvAN1-yFJ1NxffT7PkGkCiuPg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP CSP Information Form</a> which provides the PMO with information about their CSO.
- A draft call agenda, you will receive instructions on this agenda upon completion of the CSP Information Form submission
- <b><u>NOTE!</b></u> While the PMO cannot assist CSPs in securing agency partners for FedRAMP Authorization, an intake call can still be scheduled if an agency partner has yet to be identified or confirmed.
Once the form and agenda are completed, there will be instructions provided for scheduling an intake call using FedRAMP’s appointment scheduler. The appointments are held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 2:30 PM - 4:00 PM ET. 

<h4>After the call, what can I expect?</h4>  
A member from the PMO will follow-up with the CSP to provide appropriate guidance and next steps based on what was discussed during the call, including requirements for scheduling a Kickoff Meeting.

We look forward to continuing our engagement with industry and we hope you found this information helpful!
