FedRAMP requires Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to undergo an annual security assessment of their Cloud Service Offering (CSO) per security control CA-2. Both CSPs and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) are responsible for submitting components of a complete Annual Assessment package. Outlined below is a high-level breakdown of the requirements for each stakeholder. For more detailed information review the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Annual_Assessment_Guidance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Annual Assessment Guidance</a>.  

**Required CSP Package Items:**
- Current version of the System Security Plan (SSP) and all attachments
- Annual Incident Response Plan Test Report
- Annual Contingency Plan Test Report
- Plan Of Action and Milestones (POA&M)

**Required 3PAO Package Items:**
- Security Assessment Plan (SAP)
- Security Assessment Report (SAR) and related artifacts, such as raw vulnerability scan results and other evidence collected during the assessment

In addition, it is the CSPâ€™s responsibility to verify the 3PAO has uploaded the 3PAO-provided documents and to notify FedRAMP via <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a> and the authorizing official, either the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) or Agency Authorizing Official (AO), that the package is ready for review and approval.
