FedRAMP updated its [Marketplace Designations for Cloud Service Providers](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Marketplace_Designations_for_Cloud_Service_Providers.pdf) (CSPs) guidance document to clarify requirements for achieving a FedRAMP Marketplace designation. This document defines each of FedRAMPâ€™s Marketplace designations and lists the criteria a Cloud Service Offering (CSO) must meet to achieve and maintain each designation. 
 
<strong>Updates to this document include:</strong>
- Clarifies requirements for achieving the In Process designation.
- Outlines a new provision for CSOs when federal agencies are no longer using the offering.

<strong>What is the [FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/products?sort=productName)?</strong>

The Marketplace is the authoritative source for CSOs that have achieved a FedRAMP Marketplace designation. Federal agencies can use the FedRAMP Marketplace to research which CSOs have achieved a FedRAMP Ready, In Process, or Authorized status.
