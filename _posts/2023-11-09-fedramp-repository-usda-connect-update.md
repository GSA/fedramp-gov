As a reminder for all FedRAMP Office of Management and Budget (OMB) MAX system users, the repository will be transitioning to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Connect, which will <b>officially go live on December 4th</b>. USDA Connect will be the repository solution for FedRAMP document storage and collaboration needs moving forward.

<h4>So, what does this mean for users?</h4>
To ensure all data is securely transferred, the system will be down from Monday, November 27th at 5:00 pm EST until December 4th when Connect will officially become the FedRAMP repository. During the downtime, users will still be able to access their data via OMB MAX but will not be able to upload new information. Starting December 4th, users will log into USDA Connect at community.connect.gov using their credentials from OMB MAX. The user interface will be similar, and users will have the same capabilities on Connect as they did through OMB MAX.

<h4>Next Steps and Resources</h4>
Before December 4, users should test their access to the Connect portal by going to community.connect.gov. If you are not able to login to USDA Connect, you may need to work with your system administrator to add the link to your organizationâ€™s AllowList of safe sites to access. If you have any issues logging into Connect, please email <a href="maxtransition@usda.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maxtransition@usda.gov</a>.

If you have questions about the FedRAMP repository transition, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@fedramp.gov</a>. In addition, we will be hosting a FedRAMP Office Hours session on December 5th from 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM EST where we will review the Connect portal and answer questions you may have. Please be on the lookout for an invitation in the coming weeks.
