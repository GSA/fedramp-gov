As a reminder for all FedRAMP Office of Management and Budget (OMB) MAX system users, the repository will be transitioning to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Connect, which will officially <b>go live on December 4th</b>. USDA Connect will be the repository solution for FedRAMP document storage and collaboration needs moving forward.

<h4>What does this mean for users?</h4>
To ensure all data is securely transferred, OMB MAX will be down from Monday, November 27th at 5:00 pm EST until December 4th when Connect will officially become the FedRAMP repository. During the downtime, users will still be able to access their data via OMB MAX but will not be able to upload new information. Starting December 4, users will log into USDA Connect through <a href="https://community.connect.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community.connect.gov</a> using their credentials from OMB MAX. 

On December 4, logging directly into OMB MAX will redirect users to their agency homepage, and they will continue to have access to Open Executive Branch content. All Max.gov URLs will redirect to migrated content on connect.gov. There will be no changes to the login process.

<h4>Next Steps and Resources</h4>
Before December 4, we encourage users to test their access to USDA Connect by going to community.connect.gov. Although this is currently the OMB MAX page, this step will help in preparation for the transition to the USDA Connect portal. If you are not able to login to USDA Connect, you may need to work with your system administrator to add the link to your organizationâ€™s exception list of safe sites to access. If you have any issues logging into Connect, please email <a href="mailto:maxtransition@usda.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maxtransition@usda.gov</a>.

If you have questions about the FedRAMP repository transition, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@fedramp.gov</a>. In addition, we will be hosting a FedRAMP Office Hours session on December 5th from 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM EST where we will review the Connect portal and answer questions you may have. Please be on the lookout for an invitation in the coming weeks.
