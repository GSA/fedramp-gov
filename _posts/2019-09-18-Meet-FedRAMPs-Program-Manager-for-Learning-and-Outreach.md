The FedRAMP PMO is excited to introduce Betsy Steele, FedRAMP's Program Manager for Learning and Outreach. Betsy ensures that the program offers impactful training and engages in meaningful dialogue with stakeholders during 2019’s Year of TLC: Technology, Learning, and the Customer. The FedRAMP PMO sat down with Betsy to learn about her background, vision, and goals for the FedRAMP Training and Outreach Program.

**FedRAMP PMO: What is your background?**
<p>
Betsy: I’ve been working in the Federal Government for over 15 years. Before joining FedRAMP, I worked in various roles in GSA including Marketing and Communications, Project Management and Acquisition, and Digital Government. I also managed the government-wide Terms of Service Program.
  </p>

**What is top of mind for you for FedRAMP training and outreach?**
<p>
The FedRAMP Training and Outreach program has some exciting offerings on the horizon. First, we’ll be launching an on-demand version of our popular Agency Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) in-person training. Additionally, in response to customer feedback, we have partnered with GSA/FAS Office of Customer and Stakeholder Engagement (CaSE) to pilot issuing Continuing Learning Points (CLPs) for Agency stakeholders that successfully complete an ISSO in-person or online training. Finally, we completed a series of seven 3PAO on-demand trainings that you can access on the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/learning/online-courses/">Online Courses</a> page of the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/">FedRAMP website</a>. 
</p>

**What are your overarching training goals?**  
FedRAMP’s Training goals are to: 
* Make training accessible, impactful, and timely by offering online and in-person trainings customized to our stakeholders’ individual needs
* Ensure that our stakeholders are equipped with adequate knowledge  to successfully complete each stage of the FedRAMP authorization process 
* Increase engagement, enrollment, and customer satisfaction with FedRAMP’s online and in-person training 

**In your opinion, how can we best meet our customer’s needs?**
<p>
Customer feedback is critical to FedRAMP. The program must constantly evolve and adapt to meet the needs of our customers. We’re in the process of accepting submissions for the 
<a href="https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_a909oTEezNr3zFj">FedRAMP Annual Survey</a>. We will use the results to better understand how the program is performing and to determine the changes the program should make to better meet our customer’s needs. The survey is up until **September 24th**, so if you’ve interacted with FedRAMP in the past year, please take a moment to share your thoughts and feedback. 
  </p>

**Where can we find you when you’re not working?**
<p>
I just returned from a trip of a lifetime to Tanzania, Africa but generally you’ll find me riding my horse, Belle on the Manassas Battlefield or hanging out with my dogs, Shadow and Koko and doing volunteer work for Lab Rescue LRCP.
