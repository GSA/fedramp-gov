This milestone is also significant because it demonstrates the continued growth and maturity of the FedRAMP program as it enters into a new phase as an officially legislated program through the FedRAMP Authorization Act. FedRAMP will continue to focus its efforts on automating the authorization process to increase the speed of authorizations without compromising quality, and remain committed to meeting the needs of our stakeholders to enable the most efficient and secure authorization process possible.  

FedRAMP has demonstrated this commitment over the past two years as the number of “In Process” CSOs has increased by 50%, which means there are more CSOs than ever actively working toward a FedRAMP Authorization. There has also been a 50% increase in the number of CSOs authorized at the High impact level.  These CSOs are authorized to store the federal government’s most sensitive, unclassified data where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect to an organization. As more CSOs are authorized, federal agencies have more options for cloud services, which can lead to increased competition and better pricing.

Federal agencies are able to access and use these 300 FedRAMP Authorized CSOs listed on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> by following the instructions in the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Reusing_Authorizations_for_Cloud_Products_Quick_Guide.pdf"_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reusing Authorizations for Cloud Products Quick Guide</a>. Be on the lookout for the brand new and improved FedRAMP Marketplace to be released this Spring!

Finally, a big thank you to all of our FedRAMP stakeholders, including agencies, CSPs, 3PAOs, the JAB and the FedRAMP agency review team, for all of your hard work that went into achieving this major milestone. <b>THANK YOU!</b>
