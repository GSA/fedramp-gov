FedRAMP would like to introduce our Automation Strategy, which aims to reduce the costs and complications associated with the review and approval process of Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs). The proposed FedRAMP automation strategy will enable the sharing, processing, and analysis of assessment and continuous monitoring documentation among relevant stakeholders. This approach will expedite CSO authorizations, reduce expenditures and time, accelerate resolutions for cybersecurity threats, and ensure a more secure cloud environment for the federal government. 

To actualize the FedRAMP Automation Strategy, it is imperative that data is standardized to enable relevant stakeholders to effortlessly share and handle documentation. The National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST), in cooperation with FedRAMP, has developed the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL), a standardized, machine-readable language, to address this challenge. By providing a standard format, it empowers stakeholders to develop, submit, and consume common assessment documentation through tools that leverage OSCAL. 

Our projection for FedRAMP is that Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) will dispatch authorization packages in OSCAL format and will have automated processes to execute continuous monitoring.

<h3>So, what’s the next step?</h3>

We urge you to explore the <a href="https://demo.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_An_Automated_FedRAMP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP’s overarching Automation Strategy</a> for detailed information on the benefits and outcomes of an automated FedRAMP and to understand how agencies, CSPs, and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) can support FedRAMP's goal to diminish the cost and burden of cloud authorization for all stakeholders.
