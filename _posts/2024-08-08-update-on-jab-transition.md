We recently shared information about two key milestones for FedRAMP: the release of the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-07-26-the-next-phase-of-fedramp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP memo</a> which ushers in many significant shifts for the program, and the establishment of the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-06-04-fedramp-governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Board</a>, our new governance body. We recognize that customers have questions about how these milestones impact cloud service providers (CSPs) who were authorized or prioritized by the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and wanted to provide an update on current status and next steps.

<h4>Shift toward one FedRAMP Authorization</h4>
As we evolve the program, we are moving away from defining different tiers of authorizations (previously JAB and Agency) and toward one designation of <b></b>FedRAMP Authorized</b>. In the next few weeks, FedRAMP will remove the “authorization path” filter on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> and as a Marketplace data element. CSPs that have received a JAB Authorization will have this historic status included in their Marketplace description.

<h4>Transitioning JAB-Authorized CSPs</h4>
For JAB-authorized CSPs, we will initially transition continuous monitoring to one of the former JAB agencies – General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – or to FedRAMP itself. We expect to migrate continuous monitoring for CSPs not used by a former JAB agency to other agencies, and we are coordinating with other agencies using these JAB-authorized CSPs to identify those who can take on continuous monitoring activities. In all of these cases, the transfer will be coordinated with the receiving agency/ies, and formally documented in a designation letter. For 30 days after the transfer, FedRAMP and existing GSA, DOD, and DHS continuous monitoring teams will provide transitional support. FedRAMP will continue to generate the automated monthly summaries of service risk posture and provide those to agency customers via USDA Connect or a CSP-provided High repository.

<h4>Supporting CSPs prioritized to work with the JAB</h4>
Several CSPs were prioritized by the JAB to work with them toward a JAB Authorization, but were then paused when the JAB began work on the overall transition. FedRAMP will continue to work with all cloud services that were prioritized by the JAB and are still seeking a path to authorization. We are approaching this in the following way:

- <b>Authorizations by one or more agencies:</b> CSPs who were prioritized by the JAB and have one or more agency customers interested in authorizing the cloud product.
- <b>Authorizations by FedRAMP:</b> In the short term, the FedRAMP team will work with a limited number of prioritized CSPs who do not have an immediate agency partner to issue a program authorization. Longer term, we plan to develop criteria and an approach for opening this path market-wide.

We also want to make clear that CSPs whose authorization process has been visibly paused did not do anything “wrong,” but were just unfortunately caught in the transition process. Additionally, agencies who are interested in helping to expedite the authorization process for these CSPs can come to the table to participate in joint authorizations of these products.

FedRAMP will hold a dedicated, virtual Q&A session for CSPs that were prioritized by or authorized by the JAB on August 14th at 12:00 P.M. ET and would welcome <a href="https://app.smartsheetgov.com/b/form/569dc738987649adb42e1ae2c4cc70e1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">questions in advance</a>. We will also  publish an FAQ on both the OMB memo and the JAB transition in the coming weeks.

Thank you for your continued partnership as we work to further enhance FedRAMP. If you have any questions or concerns, please email <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>.
