We recently shared information about two key milestones for FedRAMP: the release of the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-07-26-the-next-phase-of-fedramp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP memo</a> which ushers in many significant shifts for the program, and the establishment of the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-06-04-fedramp-governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Board</a>, our new governance body. With these changes, many of our customers have questions about what the transition means for CSPs who were authorized or prioritized by the JAB. Today, we’re sharing important information about the transition for these CSPs.

<h4>Shift toward one FedRAMP Authorization</h4>
As we evolve the program, we are moving away from defining authorizations (previously JAB and Agency) and toward one designation of FedRAMP Authorized. In the next few weeks, FedRAMP will remove the “authorization path” filter on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> and as a Marketplace data element. CSPs that have received a JAB Authorization will have this historic status included in their Marketplace description.

<h4>Transitioning JAB-Authorized CSPs</h4>
For JAB-authorized CSPs, FedRAMP will initially transition continuous monitoring to General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), or FedRAMP. FedRAMP will begin coordinating with agencies using JAB-authorized CSPs to engage in continuous monitoring activities. The transfer will be coordinated with the receiving agency/ies, and formally documented in a designation letter. FedRAMP and existing GSA, DOD, and DHS continuous monitoring teams will provide transitional support for 30 days after the transfer. FedRAMP will continue to generate the automated monthly summaries of service risk posture and provide those to agency customers via USDA Connect or the CSP-provided High repository.

<h4>Supporting CSPs prioritized to work with the JAB</h4>
Several CSPs were prioritized to work with the JAB toward FedRAMP Authorization, but because of the transition away from JAB, FedRAMP paused this work until a suitable transition could be determined. FedRAMP will continue to work with all cloud services that were prioritized by the JAB and are still seeking a path to authorization. We are approaching this in the following way:

- <b>Authorizations by one or more agencies:</b> CSPs who were prioritized by the JAB and have an agency customer(s) interested in authorizing the cloud product.
- <b>Authorizations by FedRAMP:</b> The FedRAMP team will work with a limited number of prioritized cloud services for a program authorization. In the short term, this path is for prioritized CSPs who do not have an immediate agency partner, with a future focus on building out criteria and an approach for opening this path market-wide.

We also want to make clear that CSPs whose authorization process has been visibly paused did not do anything “wrong,” but were caught in the transition process. Additionally, agencies who are interested in helping to expedite the authorization process for these CSPs can come to the table to participate in joint authorizations of these products.

FedRAMP is engaging directly with CSPs who are part of this transition, and is currently  <a href="https://app.smartsheetgov.com/b/form/569dc738987649adb42e1ae2c4cc70e1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capturing questions</a> for an FAQ on our website surrounding the OMB memo and JAB transition. We’re holding a dedicated, virtual Q&A session for CSPs that were prioritized by or Authorized by the JAB next week, and would welcome questions we should consider before that meeting.

Thank you for your continued partnership during these changes as we work to move FedRAMP forward. If you have any questions or concerns, please email <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>.
