<h3>How Will These Sessions Work?</h3>
Following the introduction and welcome to each meeting, the FedRAMP OSCAL Data Bites will be divided into three main sections:
- FedRAMP’s technical experts will <b>provide information on any updates or changes</b> to FedRAMP’s OSCAL usage.
- FedRAMP’s technical experts will <b>address questions</b> submitted by participants prior to the meeting. Those interested may submit questions ahead of the next session and/or requests to have specific topics covered in future meetings by filling out <a href="https://forms.gle/7vER3W3pRbR1wq6R9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a>.
- The remainder of the meeting will be an <b>open discussion</b> to allow participants to <b>engage directly with and ask questions of the team</b> working on FedRAMP automation via OSCAL.

<h3>Why is FedRAMP hosting these sessions? </h3>
Our goal is to establish and maintain regular communication with our OSCAL end-users to ensure we are addressing the needs of all stakeholders involved.
