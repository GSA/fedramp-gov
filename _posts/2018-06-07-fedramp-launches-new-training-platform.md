We’ve migrated all of our training offerings to this platform, however, we wanted to draw your attention to the following three courses that have been released in the last year:

**100-A: Welcome to FedRAMP (Released July 2017):** This course provides an overview of FedRAMP, a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This one-hour introductory course in the FedRAMP Training Series is intended for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) who aren’t well acquainted with FedRAMP. This course also serves as an excellent source of information for anyone in government or the private sector who wants to learn more about the program.

**300-A: 17020 Requirements - Understanding and Bridging the Gap (New):** This course provides 3PAOs with guidance on how FedRAMP requirements apply to ISO/IEC 17020:2012 which specifies requirements for the competence of bodies performing inspection and for the impartiality and consistency of their inspection activities.

**300-G: Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) Preparation (Released October 2017):** This course provides information about how the FedRAMP security requirements must align with a CSP’s Cloud Service Offering (CSO) security capabilities before the CSO is accepted as “FedRAMP Ready.” 

These two 300-level courses are the first of seven trainings for 3PAOs to be released and are required for all members of 3PAO assessment teams. To learn more about our training curriculum, visit our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/training/"> training webpage</a>.
