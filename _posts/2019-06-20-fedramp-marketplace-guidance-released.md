We receive thousands of questions through [info@fedramp.gov](mailto:info@fedramp.gov), and one of the most popular topics is the FedRAMP Marketplace and which cloud capabilities are _**FedRAMP Ready, In Process, or Authorized**_. With over 220 industry partners engaged with the program, the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products?sort=productName">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> is a one-stop-shop in providing visibility into the FedRAMP community. The Marketplace serves as a searchable and sortable database of Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs), aiding Agencies in the process of researching and identifying secure cloud capabilities that are available for government-wide use. It also lists the accredited auditors that can perform the FedRAMP assessment, known as Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs). With over 250,000 visits annually, the Marketplace is a valuable source of real-time information for our customers. 

Given the importance of the Marketplace, we want to ensure the information about each CSO is established in easy-to-understand guidance. The new Marketplace Guidance (document superseded by <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/about-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"About Marketplace" page</a>) outlines the various FedRAMP designations for CSOs and provides details for industry and Agencies in achieving and maintaining FedRAMP status on the Marketplace.

**Key takeaways from the Marketplace Guidance:**
* Supersedes previous guidance document, the "Agency Authorization: Requirements for In Process Designation," as part of a larger effort to streamline and consolidate our documents.  
* Explains the process for achieving and maintaining all three of our Marketplace designations.
* Includes guidance for how to achieve _**In Process**_ designation with FedRAMP when working with DoD component agencies.
* Provides tips and guidance for how to handle changes in initial agency partner or Authorizing Official (AO).

As always, if you have any questions surrounding this guidance, please contact [info@fedramp.gov](mailto:info@fedramp.gov).
