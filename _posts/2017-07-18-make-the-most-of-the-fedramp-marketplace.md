Launched last August, the [FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products?sort=productName) dashboard provides a searchable, sortable database of all cloud services that are FedRAMP authorized, FedRAMP Ready, or In Process for an authorization. The Marketplace can be used as a resource to find and learn more about cloud services associated with FedRAMP, understand which Agencies are using which authorized services, and find third party assessment organizations (3PAOs) and the services they have assessed.

**Using the Marketplace**

Each service in the marketplace has one of three statuses: FedRAMP Authorized, Ready, or In Process.

  * **FedRAMP Authorized** means the service has either a Provisional Authorization to Operate (P-ATO) via the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) or an Authorization to Operate (ATO) by an Agency and is available for use by an Agency (by leveraging the existing ATO or P-ATO).

  * **FedRAMP Ready** means the cloud service provider (CSP) has completed a Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) that has been approved by the FedRAMP PMO. This indicates that a CSP is likely to attain a JAB P-ATO an Agency ATO. While not a guarantee that the CSP will become authorized, the government has a clearer understanding of a provider’s technical capabilities before the assessment process begins so there is a greater likelihood of success in the authorization process.
  * **FedRAMP In Process** means that the service is in the process of being reviewed for a JAB P-ATO or Agency ATO.

Within the Marketplace, you can search for a particular service, provider, agency, or 3PAO to find exactly what you’re looking for. You can sort the data by status (FedRAMP Ready, Authorized, or In Process), service model (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS), deployment model (Public, Private, Government Community, or Hybrid Cloud), or impact level (Low, Moderate, or High). You can compare services side by side. There’s also a [dictionary](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/dictionary) that defines all of the terms in the descriptions.

Additionally, you can download the Marketplace data for reporting or use offline. This data export provides a list of all the Agency ATOs, JAB P-ATOs, and where these authorization have been leveraged. You can also filter for a list of CSPs that are Agency In-process (Type: Agency and no Authorization Date), in the process of working with the JAB (Type: JAB and no Authorization Date), or FedRAMP Ready (no Type or Authorization Date).

**Becoming Listed in the Marketplace**

All services listed in the Marketplace meet one of the following requirements:

* The service has been deemed FedRAMP Ready.

* An Agency has emailed info@fedramp.gov noting that they're sponsoring a CSP and has worked with the FedRAMP PMO to gather the information for the page.

* The service has an Agency ATO.

* The service has a JAB P-ATO.


The Marketplace is updated daily, so make sure to check back frequently.
