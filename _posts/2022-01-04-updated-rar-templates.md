FedRAMP has updated the Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) Guide and templates (linked below) in order to provide enhanced guidance for Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs).

- <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-High-RAR-Template.docx">FedRAMP High Readiness Assessment Report Template</a>
- <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Moderate-RAR-Template.docx">FedRAMP Moderate Readiness Assessment Report Template</a>
- <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/3PAO_Readiness_Assessment_Report_Guide.pdf">FedRAMP 3PAO Readiness Assessment Report Guide</a>

The updates to both of the RAR templates and the guide aim to:

- Streamline template sections/tables to simplify and reduce duplication and complexity
- Clarify requirements and instructions based on feedback from 3PAOs and CSPs 
- Align the RAR with current FedRAMP guidance and requirements  

The intent of the RAR is for a 3PAO to document a Cloud Service Offering’s (CSO) management, technical, and operational capabilities and attest a CSO’s readiness for the FedRAMP authorization process. By completing a RAR, a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is able to understand if their CSO has the key capabilities to obtain a FedRAMP authorization. While the CSP should review the RAR for accuracy, the 3PAO has ownership of the RAR and is fully responsible for its content.
