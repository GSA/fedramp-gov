<h4>FedRAMP Announces Key Performance Metrics for Public Comment</h4>
As we outlined in our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-03-28-a-new-roadmap-for-fedramp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP roadmap</a>, we're committed to continuously improving FedRAMP to better serve our stakeholders.

Today, we are asking for public feedback on a proposed set of metrics that would measure the end-to-end FedRAMP authorization experience and align with our mission of being a security-first program. We will use the feedback we get on these metrics to focus and refine this list to a set of measures that will keep FedRAMP focused on security and customer experience.

For years, people in industry and government have asked FedRAMP reasonable questions, such as:
- How long does a FedRAMP authorization take?
- How expensive is a FedRAMP authorization?
- How much does it cost an agency to partner with a cloud provider for a FedRAMP authorization?
- What are the biggest “show-stoppers” that stop cloud providers from achieving a FedRAMP authorization?
- How quickly can an agency reuse an already authorized product?

To help us answer these questions, our proposed metrics are broken out across two areas:
- <b>An end-to-end customer experience:</b> This will start the moment an organization decides they would like to pursue a FedRAMP authorization, continuing through the authorization phase itself, and then ongoing continuous monitoring that is required to maintain an authorization.
- <b>A security-first program:</b> FedRAMP provides a <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> trusted marketplace</a> to our stakeholders by integrating security into our metrics we aim to build upon that trust and create efficiencies. We want to measure how well authorized CSOs are meeting our security standards, and identify any gaps at an aggregate level. Understanding common security gaps can help us avoid unnecessary back-and-forth during the authorization process. By gathering metrics on these recurring issues, we can better focus our guidance and training efforts.

The metrics are designed to capture the experiences of different customers and partners, as well as FedRAMP’s performance.

<h4>How to Help Us</h4>
We encourage all stakeholders, including CSPs, federal agencies, 3PAOs, and the general public to provide feedback on these proposed metrics. As you review these metrics, please help us make our metrics comprehensive, accurate, and something that speaks to your needs. 

These metrics are not exhaustive and FedRAMP plans to revisit metrics each year to ensure we are updating our metric with the changing landscape of the program.  Future metrics will also be further informed by the FedRAMP Government Risk and Compliance (GRC) platform buildout.
