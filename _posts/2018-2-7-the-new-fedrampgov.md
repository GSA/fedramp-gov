As you may have noticed, the FedRAMP website has a new look! We’ve spent the past few months revamping and streamlining the content and layout of the website based on user feedback and our website analytics. We’ve tried to keep the most critical and popular information in the same place to ease the transition, but we’d like to walk you through some of the changes you will see.  

First, we upgraded the FedRAMP homepage to have a sleeker and more user friendly interface. You’ll find easy access to our “Partners We Serve” pages and our most recent <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog">Focus on FedRAMP</a> blog posts on this page. 

The “Participate” tab is now titled “Partners We Serve” and focuses on our three key stakeholders: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cloud-service-providers">Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/federal-agencies">Agencies</a>, and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assessors">Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs). The content on these pages has been updated to reflect the most recent information about program. 

Next we moved <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/training">Training</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tips-cues">Tips & Cues</a> to the “Resources” tab. We did this to consolidate all of our training and guidance into one place, hopefully making it easier for you to find.

Finally, we added a “Get Authorized” tab that has a page on both <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/jab-authorization">JAB Authorization Board (JAB)</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/agency-authorization">Agency</a> Authorizations. These pages take you through the phases of each authorization and provide a high-level overview of what you can expect. 

As with any transition, we may experience some technical glitches over the next few weeks, so please be patient with us as we continue to upgrade and improve our site. 

We couldn’t be more excited to share this new website with you, and we hope that you find it easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing. If you have any questions, please reach out to info@fedramp.gov.
