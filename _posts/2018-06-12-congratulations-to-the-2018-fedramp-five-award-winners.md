We’re thrilled to announce the winners of the first-ever FedRAMP Five Awards, which recognize our federal government partners for their commitment to cybersecurity excellence. These awardees have all demonstrated exceptional engagement with the FedRAMP program that has greatly improved the strength of the program and the services that their organizations are able to deliver to their stakeholders. Their achievements and accomplishments are detailed below.

Please join us in applauding these winners for their dedication to FedRAMP and their continued efforts in improving the program. 

**Large Agency Award:** Department of Health and Human Services
<p>
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Cloud Security Team (CST) has been a steadfast partner to the FedRAMP program since its inception. In 2013, HHS issued the first-ever FedRAMP Agency Authorization. Since that point, HHS has continued its active participation with the program by initiating authorizations for more than 10 cloud service offerings (CSOs), participating in FedRAMP training days and panels, and providing input on FedRAMP policies and guidance. To date, HHS has been the most active Agency in terms of using FedRAMP authorized services, with a government-leading 46 FedRAMP Authorized or In Process products in use.

**Small Agency Award:** Federal Communications Commission
<p>
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has made prolific use of authorized Cloud Service Providers, and has the most authorized and in-process CSOs of any small Agency at 17 Authorized or In Process. FCC regularly sponsors new FedRAMP authorizations to ensure the best solutions are available for government. Furthermore, FCC actively participates in PMO events, such as ISSO Training Days, to further improve and support the FedRAMP program.

**Large Agency Tech Lead Award:** Steven Hunt, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
<p>
Steven Hunt serves as the IT Governance Lead for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Enterprise Managed Cloud Computing office, where he has led development and implementation of a robust Enterprise-Class Cloud A&A Framework. The Framework is comprised of leading-edge policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines aligned with FedRAMP, NIST, and Agency requirements and objectives, allowing NASA to minimize compliance burden while enabling secure, mission-supporting services. Steven is an evangelist and supporter of FedRAMP, and demonstrates a consistent willingness to provide input on FedRAMP initiatives to help improve the program.

**Small Agency Tech Lead Award:** Greg Gray, Broadcasting Board of Governors
<p>
As the Chief Security Information Officer (CISO) for the Broadcasting Board of Governors, Greg Gray demonstrated a forward-thinking approach to cybersecurity when he partnered with the FedRAMP PMO for the first-ever FedRAMP Tailored authorizations: Adobe Sign and Adobe Creative Cloud. Greg has been a trusted advisor and a willing partner to the FedRAMP program, providing guidance on new and proposed program processes, guidelines, and documentation.

**Future Leader Award:** Daniel Pane, HHS
<p>
Daniel Pane, FedRAMP Lead for HHS, has been integral to the implementation and continued success of HHS FedRAMP efforts. Both before and during this role, Daniel has led efforts to standardize FedRAMP efforts across HHS, while utilizing modern risk management techniques. In his current role, Daniel has led efforts to sponsor and authorize multiple CSOs, provided guidance and training both internally and cross-Agency, and participated in various FedRAMP PMO efforts, to include training day panels and documentation reviews. As a result, HHS is considered one of the government leaders when it comes to FedRAMP and cloud security.
