Both Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Federal Agencies play a role in Continuous Monitoring. FedRAMP Authorized CSPs are required to perform Continuous Monitoring to maintain a sufficient security posture. Federal Agencies are obligated to review a CSP’s Continuous Monitoring artifacts to determine if an Authority-to-Operate (ATO) is appropriate over the life of the system. 

Completing Continuous Monitoring and managing multiple ATOs can become challenging when multiple agencies leverage a common cloud service. In order to help Agencies navigate this process and better perform Continuous Monitoring, FedRAMP published Guidance for Managing Multi-Agency Continuous Monitoring. In this blog post, we walk you through the benefits, best practices, and resources outlined in this guide. 

Why Multi-Agency Continuous Monitoring? 
Multi-Agency collaboration on Continuous Monitoring benefits participating agencies by creating a collaborative forum to:
* Enforce a shared responsibility for the security posture of a cloud service
* Shift the evaluation and decision-making regarding a CSP’s security posture from a single leveraging agency to multiple agencies
* Create a shared understanding of the assessment and evaluation protocol for the ongoing security posture of a cloud service.
* Mitigate the inefficiencies of agencies independently evaluating the ongoing security posture for a commonly leveraged cloud service


What are Best Practices to Conduct Multi-Agency Continuous Monitoring?

**1) Establish a Collaboration Group of Agencies Leveraging a Common Cloud Service** 

Collaboration groups provide a means for Agencies to join together and support one another in a forum for the performance of Continuous Monitoring with a CSP. These groups should be comprised primarily of agencies leveraging a common cloud service, as well as the CSP. Including a Third Party Assessor Organization (3PAO) is at the discretion of the CSP, but is encouraged by the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO). 
 
Agencies establishing a Collaboration Group should:
* Ratify a charter that specifies the organization, activities, and governance of the Collaboration Group
* Schedule a regular cadence of meetings (e.g., monthly, quarterly) among Collaboration Group members and the CSP
* Formalize a standard agenda and communication channels for sharing questions, meeting minutes, and decision points across member agencies
* Define mechanisms for determining a majority vote among member agencies and processes for member protest, arbitration, and dispute resolution.

**2) Define the Common ‘High Water Mark’ a CSP Must Achieve to Address all Participating Agencies’ Requirements**

Collaboration Groups should standardize the Continuous Monitoring requirements that a CSP must meet to streamline the review and approval of a cloud service security posture, including:
* Developing a standard report that summarizes a CSP’s Continuous Monitoring evidence and presents a rolling picture of the service’s security posture 
* Defining common nomenclature and taxonomy for communicating Continuous Monitoring evidence that is agreed upon by member agencies and the CSP 
* Defining a governance process for the onboarding of new leveraging agencies and rationalization of agency-specific requirements relative to the Collaboration Group’s standardized requirements
* If applicable, identify agency-specific Continuous Monitoring requirements that specific participating agencies require per FISMA / FITARA

**3) Define a Governance Protocol for the Evaluation, Approval, and Review of Proposed Significant Changes by the CSP**

Evaluation and approval of significant changes is often a sticking point in the management of ATOs for a cloud service across multiple agencies. Collaboration Groups should consider the following to streamline processes for proposed changes to a cloud service:
* Define a ‘lowest common denominator’ for the qualification of a proposed change by a CSP as a significant change. Ask: What does each participating agency consider to be a significant a change? 
* Align the group’s significant change protocol to the FedRAMP Significant Change Request Form. Leverage FedRAMP’s Significant Change Policies and Procedures 
* Encourage the CSP to clarify anticipated security impact of a proposed change to current agency-specific use cases of the cloud service 

We hope the above best practices further multi-agency collaboration on Continuous Monitoring. For additional resources, see below, or visit our FedRAMP website. Additional questions can be addressed to info@fedramp.gov.
