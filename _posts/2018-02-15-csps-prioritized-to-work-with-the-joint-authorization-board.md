Over the last 6 months we completed the latest round of FedRAMP Connect where Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are prioritized to work with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB).  In order to prioritize the right CSPs, the FedRAMP PMO reviews each business case submitted by CSPs interested in pursuing a JAB authorization and analyzes their current and potential demand. The focus of this process is to choose the CSPs that offer services that will benefit the widest variety of Agencies across the Federal Government.

For this round of FedRAMP Connect, we wanted to provide some additional detail around the demand component of the preferential criteria and the results of the most recent round. 

**Demand Criteria**

Demand is a go / no-go criteria for prioritization and a CSP was required to provide verification of current or potential demand from the equivalent of six customers to be considered for the JAB. In order to calculate demand, the PMO counted each proven current Federal Government customer as one (1) and proof of potential demand as a fourth (or .25). Potential demand includes current state and local customers.

**FedRAMP Connect Results**

For this round of FedRAMP Connect, the demand proven by CSPs ranged from 0 to 106.75. When demand was considered equal, FedRAMP Ready became a determining factor for prioritization, reiterating the importance of this for vendors who meet the demand threshold, but might not be ranked as high as other vendors. Based on the demand and FedRAMP Ready status of the top CSPs, we prioritized 5 vendors to work with the JAB and did not need to evaluate the business cases based on the additional preferential criteria. We reviewed our analysis with GSA’s Office of General Counsel, presented our analysis to the CIO Council for any additional feedback, and ultimately provided this to the JAB for their final decision. The following five CSPs were ultimately prioritized by the JAB: 

 * Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), a Teletrac Navman Company - DIRECTOR®
 * Infor - Infor Government SaaS (IGS)
 * Mantech - Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation (CDM) Shared Services
 * Monster Government Solutions - Monster Hiring Management Enterprise (MHME)
 * Xerox Corporation - MPS for US Federal Government

We are excited to work with these vendors in the coming months, especially with such a broad range of services across the Federal Government. 

Please keep your eyes peeled for future blogs about our next round of FedRAMP Connect. We’re currently anticipating opening submissions in early Summer 2018.
