FedRAMP is excited to announce that the first Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) formatted System Security Plan (SSP) was accepted from a FedRAMP authorized Cloud Service Provider (CSP). This is a milestone achievement for the program and kickstarts FedRAMPs ability to apply automated validations. 

FedRAMP encourages CSPs and 3PAOs to begin using <a href="https://github.com/GSA/fedramp-automation/tree/master/src/validations#what-is-this" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automated validation</a> rules to self-test prior to submitting a package to FedRAMP. As the automated validations process progresses, FedRAMP will release more rules for industry to use. You can find more information using the following resources:

<h4>How Did We Get Here?</h4> 
The FedRAMP PMO, in collaboration with NIST, has been working to standardize authorization packages and streamline their review with a common machine-readable language, also known as OSCAL. In June 2021, NIST released <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 1.0.0 of OSCAL</a> and in August 2021, FedRAMP released the first set of validation rules via <a href="https://github.com/GSA/fedramp-automation/tree/master/src/validations#what-is-this" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. 

<h4> What’s the Big Deal?</h4>  
As CSPs continue to adopt the OSCAL format, FedRAMP anticipates a more efficient use of time and resources for processing package submissions. To further leverage OSCAL, FedRAMP developed a set of <a href="https://github.com/GSA/fedramp-automation/tree/master/src/validations#what-is-this" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">validation rules</a> to enable automated initial reviews. These automated reviews will: 
- Expedite the time it takes to review packages and complete initial checks for completeness  and common errors 
- Allow FedRAMP reviewers to focus on more complex elements of the review 
- Provide consistent feedback with structured markup, just like FedRAMP reviewers do today. FedRAMP will continuously update validation rules to automate increasingly complex review checks
- Allow FedRAMP to notify CSPs earlier when a package does not meet initial requirements
- Enable CSPs and 3PAOs to conduct self-tests prior to submitting a package

<h4>What’s Next?</h4> 
FedRAMP is currently accepting all authorization deliverables submitted in the OSCAL format and hopes to receive more deliverables as CSPs adopt this machine-readable formatting language. FedRAMP will also continue to accept authorization deliverables in Word format and final versions can be submitted in PDF, after a FedRAMP Authorized designation is achieved.
