FedRAMP Receives an OSCAL Formatted System Security Plan (SSP)
FedRAMP is excited to announce that the first Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) formatted System Security Plan (SSP) was accepted from a FedRAMP authorized Cloud Service Provider (CSP.) This is a milestone achievement for the program and kickstarts FedRAMPs ability to apply automated validations. 

FedRAMP encourages CSPs and 3PAOs to begin using automated validation rules to self-test prior to submitting a package to FedRAMP. As the automated validations process progresses, FedRAMP will release more rules for industry to use. You can find more information using the following resources:

How Did We Get Here? 
The FedRAMP PMO, in collaboration with NIST, has been working to standardize authorization packages and streamline their review with a common machine-readable language, also known as OSCAL. In June 2021, NIST released version 1.0.0 of OSCAL and in August 2021, FedRAMP released the first set of validation rules via GitHub. 

What’s the Big Deal? 
As CSPs continue to adopt the OSCAL format, FedRAMP anticipates a more efficient use of time and resources for processing package submissions. To further leverage OSCAL, FedRAMP developed a set of validation rules to enable automated initial reviews. These automated reviews will: 

Expedite the time it takes to review packages and complete initial checks for completeness  and common errors 
Allow FedRAMP reviewers to focus on more complex elements of the review 
Provide consistent feedback with structured markup, just like FedRAMP reviewers do today. FedRAMP will continuously update validation rules to automate increasingly complex review checks
Allow FedRAMP to notify CSPs earlier when a package does not meet initial requirements
Enable CSPs and 3PAOs to conduct self-tests prior to submitting a package

What’s Next? 
FedRAMP is currently accepting all authorization deliverables submitted in the OSCAL format and hopes to receive more deliverables as CSPs adopt this machine-readable formatting language. FedRAMP will also continue to accept authorization deliverables in Word format and final versions can be submitted in PDF, after a FedRAMP Authorized designation is achieved.

At the end of 2020, National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) released Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Rev. 5 catalog of security and privacy controls and SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations. Since, FedRAMP has been administering the following approach to implement the baseline updates: 

- **Step 1 [COMPLETED]:** Develop draft FedRAMP Baselines from NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Updates
- **Step 2 [COMPLETED]:** Release draft FedRAMP Baselines for Public Comment
- **Step 3 [IN PROGRESS]:** Update FedRAMP Baselines and Documentation Based on Public Comments
- **Step 4 [UPCOMING]:** Release Final Rev5 FedRAMP Baseline Documentation Updates and CSP Implementation Plan

As of April 1, 2022, the public comment period has ended and the FedRAMP PMO has moved into Step 3 of the process. FedRAMP will share updates with our government partners and industry stakeholders as we proceed with this transition. 

<h4>What's Next?</h4>
The final version of FedRAMP’s updated Rev. 5 baselines (including OSCAL versions), associated documentation and templates, an implementation guide, and compliance timeline will be published once all steps have been completed. FedRAMP will also provide training and educational forums specific to the Rev. 5 updates and transition process.

Please contact <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a> if you have any questions about these pending updates, and check out our prior blog announcements for additional information on FedRAMP’s transition to Rev. 5.
