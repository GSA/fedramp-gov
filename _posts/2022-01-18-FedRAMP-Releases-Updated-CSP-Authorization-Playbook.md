FedRAMP published an updated <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Authorization_Playbook_Getting_Started_with_FedRAMP.pdf">Cloud Service Providers (CSP) Authorization Playbook</a> to provide CSPs with a more detailed understanding of the FedRAMP Authorization process now in two volumes. 
 
**Volume I** helps CSPs understand the FedRAMP Authorization process and develop a strategy for achieving FedRAMP Authorization. Volume I includes:  

- How CSPs can get started with FedRAMP
- Introducing the paths to authorization
- FedRAMP designations
- Considerations that CSPs should think about prior to pursuing an authorization 
 
**Volume II** helps CSPs understand how to develop a high-quality security package for an expeditious and efficient FedRAMP Authorization to cut down rework and delays during the review process. Volume II includes:   

- Elements of an authorization package
- Guidance for developing key artifacts 
- Tips for delivering a clean, easy-to-review package
 
While the CSP Authorization Playbook is written to inform Cloud Service Providers approaching the FedRAMP Authorization process, the information is helpful to all FedRAMP stakeholders.
