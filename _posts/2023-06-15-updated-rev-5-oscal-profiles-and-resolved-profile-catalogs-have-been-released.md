FedRAMP has released the second wave of Rev. 5 documents: the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) FedRAMP Rev. 5 baseline profiles and resolved profile catalogs! OSCAL is a language developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration with FedRAMP to reduce the time and resources to prepare, authorize, and reuse cloud products and services. The updated documents will assist stakeholders who leverage OSCAL to reduce time and cost by automating their FedRAMP authorization and continuous monitoring requirements.
