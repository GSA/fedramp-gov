As 2020 begins, the FedRAMP PMO reflected on the achievements and progress for both the program and the stakeholder community in 2019. The PMO is proud of what the program achieved by growing the use of secure cloud across the government through strong partnerships.
 
Thank you for your collaboration over the past year, and we look forward to 2020 as we streamline, simplify, and stay committed to continuous improvement.
