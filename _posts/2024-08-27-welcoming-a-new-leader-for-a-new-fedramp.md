After an extensive search, we are thrilled to welcome <a href="https://github.com/pete-gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Waterman</a> as our new FedRAMP Director. Pete has served as a senior technical advisor with the Technology Modernization Fund here at GSA, as CISO at the Office of Management and Budget, as an engineer with the U.S. Digital Service, VP of Engineering at a small cloud service provider, and other technology positions across both the public and private sector.

We went into this search knowing that we wanted someone who would help us stay grounded in FedRAMP’s mission to help agencies take full advantage of cloud services while furthering FedRAMP’s cybersecurity leadership. It’s a big task, and Pete is a terrific fit for it. He will oversee the continued delivery and iteration of the FedRAMP roadmap initiatives, continue growing the FedRAMP team, and work closely with the FedRAMP Board to drive the program forward.

Of course, our growth extends beyond just this position. We’ve brought on multiple new team members to expand the program’s technical capacity and operations, and have more joining in the coming weeks. FedRAMP’s Security Director position opens tomorrow, Wednesday, August 28 (<a href="https://join.tts.gsa.gov/join/FedRAMP-Security-Director/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consider applying</a>!). 

As FedRAMP continues to engage with the public, through the Federal Secure Cloud Advisory Council, industry forums, and other events, we hope you’ll <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">say hello to our new Director</a> and the rest of our team!
