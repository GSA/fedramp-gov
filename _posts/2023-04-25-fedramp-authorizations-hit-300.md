FedRAMP is excited to announce that we just reached a huge milestone: 300 FedRAMP Authorized Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs)!  Federal agencies now have access to more CSOs that they need to do their jobs effectively and efficiently, from remote access and scalability, to collaboration and efficiency, just to name a few. As more CSOs are authorized, federal agencies have more options for cloud services, which can lead to increased competition and better pricing. This milestone is also significant because it highlights the continued growth and maturity of the FedRAMP program.  

Over the past two years, the number of “In Process” CSOs has increased by 50%, which means there are more CSOs than ever actively working toward a FedRAMP Authorization. In addition, there has been a 50% increase in the number of CSOs authorized at the High impact level.  These CSOs are authorized to store the federal government’s most sensitive, unclassified data where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect to an organization.

FedRAMP continues to focus its efforts on automating the authorization process to increase the speed of authorizations without compromising quality, and remains committed to meeting the needs of our stakeholders to enable the most efficient and secure authorization process possible. 

Federal agencies are able to access and use these 300 FedRAMP Authorized CSOs listed on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> by following the instructions in the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Reusing_Authorizations_for_Cloud_Products_Quick_Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reusing Authorizations for Cloud Products Quick Guide</a>. 

Finally, the FedRAMP PMO would like to extend a big thank you to all of our FedRAMP stakeholders, including agencies, cloud service providers, Third-Party Assessment Organizations, , the Joint Authorization Board and the FedRAMP agency review team, for all the hard work that went into achieving this major milestone. <b>THANK YOU!</b>
