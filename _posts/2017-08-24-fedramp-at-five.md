We are excited to share our FedRAMP At Five graphic, celebrating over five years of the FedRAMP program; it's accomplishments, impacts, and continued activities. Building on these milestones, we hope to continue our trend of exponential growth, innovative process improvements, and collaboration among the community of government and private industry. While we continue to look forward in the program, we wanted to take a moment to look back and see all we have accomplished in just five short years.

Thank you to all who have helped us improve this program over the last five years and we look forward to continuing to deliver, iterate, and enhance FedRAMP as we move into our sixth year.
