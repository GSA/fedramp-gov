As we recently outlined in our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-03-28-a-new-roadmap-for-fedramp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP roadmap</a>, we're committed to continuously improving the program to better serve our stakeholders. As a result, we are releasing a list of metrics for public comment that focus on the end-to-end authorization experience and align with our mission of being a security-driven program. Our goal is to use this open comment period as a way to survey our stakeholders to help refine this list to later release a list that the program can confidently say has the greatest impact to our stakeholders.

FedRAMP has worked closely with industry and government stakeholders over the years and is often asked questions like:
- How long does a FedRAMP Authorization take?
- How expensive is a FedRAMP Authorization?
- How much does it cost an agency to partner with a CSP for a FedRAMP Authorization?
- What are the biggest “show-stoppers” to achieving a FedRAMP Authorization?
- How quickly can an agency reuse an already authorized product?

Today, in service of listening and hearing our stakeholders, we've identified two areas we expect these metrics to address:
- <b>An end-to-end customer experience:</b> This will span from the moment an organization company decides they would like to pursue a FedRAMP Authorization, the authorization phase itself, and all ongoing continuous monitoring that is required to maintain an authorization. We expect these metrics will provide greater transparency to all of our stakeholders and drive meaningful insights.
- <b>A security-first program:</b> As a security and risk management program we believe that our metrics should align with our mission of promoting the adoption of secure cloud services across the federal government. Balancing the need to provide secure products to the FedRAMP marketplace while considering how long and costly the process is 

The metrics are designed to capture the stakeholder experiences we have categorized the metrics by the primary stakeholder the metrics would come from:
- Cloud service providers (CSPs)
- Third-party assessment organizations (3PAOs)
- Federal agencies
- FedRAMP’s Program Performance

<h4>Goals, Approach, and Expected Outcomes</h4>
Our goal with these metrics is to provide a clear, accurate, and actionable representation of FedRAMP’s performance.
1. <b>Comprehensive capture of the FedRAMP Authorization Process:</b>
  - <b>Goal:</b> The goal is to gain an understanding of the time and costs associated with the FedRAMP authorization journey, accurately reflecting the experiences of both the Federal Agencies, Cloud Service Provides  (CSPs) and Third Party Assessors (3PAOs). This involves considering the varied scenarios and challenges faces by different types of CSPs during the authorization process,
  - <b>Approach:</b> The approach is to update real-time data gathering to provide accurate estimates of costs and time at each stage of the authorization process. This will be enabled by asking our stakeholders for data throughout the authorization process on data values on information such as time, cost, and other values that may be relevant for data capture.
2. <b>Establishment of FedRAMP-Controlled Performance Metrics for SLAs:</b>
  - <b>Goal:</b> The goal is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the FedRAMP Process through the identification and development of specific performance metrics and clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs) This involves capturing the relevant data to track timelines in order to set and measure SLAs to ensure a timely and reliable delivery of service. 
  - <b>Approach:</b> The approach includes regularly monitoring and reporting on these metrics to ensure alignment with program goals and to involve the overall stakeholder experience.

<h4>How to Help Us</h4>
We encourage all stakeholders, including CSPs, federal agencies, 3PAOs and the general public to provide feedback on these proposed metrics. Your insights are vital to ensuring that our metrics are comprehensive, accurate, and will help to continually improve FedRAMP. These metrics are not exhaustive and FedRAMP plans to revisit metrics each year to ensure we are updating our metric with the changing landscape of the program.  Future metrics will also be further informed by the FedRAMP Government Risk and Compliance (GRC) platform buildout.

<b>Questions to consider when reviewing the Metrics:</b>
1. In your opinion, what are the most important metrics for assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of The FedRAMP process?
2. How would you define success regarding timeliness and cost effectiveness of the authorization process?
3. What types of SLAs would help you manage you expectations and improve your experience during the FedRAMO authorization process?
4. Do you use specific performance metrics within your organization to monitor progress?
