The FedRAMP PMO is excited to announce the official passing of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr8956/BILLS-117hr8956rfs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Authorization Act</a> as part of the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), recognizing and codifying the work FedRAMP and its stakeholders have completed over the last decade. President Biden’s signing of the NDAA is a notable milestone in securing the federal government’s cloud-first mission. The law’s most important feature is reciprocity, enabling agencies to authorize vendors more easily and access more cyber-secure services. The bill calls on GSA to increase the speed, effectiveness, and transparency of the authorization process, and mandates the creation of a Secure Cloud Advisory Committee to advise FedRAMP leadership. The Committee will be composed of no more than 15 qualified representatives from the public and private sectors.

<b>Key benefits of the bill include:</b>
- Improving the speed at which new cloud computing products and services can be securely authorized
- Enhancing the ability of agencies to effectively evaluate FedRAMP-authorized providers for reuse
- Reducing the burdens to cloud providers seeking a FedRAMP authorization

We will share with our stakeholders how the bill will impact them in the near future, including how the Secure Cloud Advisory Committee will be formed. Please keep an eye out on all FedRAMP Communication channels for any updates around the FedRAMP process.

We understand that you are curious about the immediate next steps. We ask that you limit the amount of inquiries regarding the bill sent to <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>. The PMO will be releasing further guidance over time. Once the PMO provides additional guidance about the impacts of the bill, please feel free to reach out with any questions. We thank you in advance for your cooperation.
