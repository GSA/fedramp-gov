The FedRAMP team has been improving documentation through streamlining content, removing duplicative information, and addressing common issues; therefore, significant updates were made to core FedRAMP security package templates (SSP, SAP, SAR). There is now one template each for the SSP, SAP and SAR. The same SSP template will be used for the “front matter” sections, with the appropriate control baseline added as an appendix. There are no longer separate SAP/SAR templates for Initial and Annual Assessments; they have been combined. The new SAP/SAR templates can also be used for Significant Change Requests. We also included more Instructional text to help CSPs and 3PAOs understand what is expected in each section of the templates.
