In order to give CSPs ample time to prepare their FedRAMP Connect Business Cases used to determine prioritization of CSPs to work with the JAB, the FedRAMP PMO has decided to extend the next Business Case due date to September 13th. 

To learn how to effectively participate in this process, we recommend CSPs read the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/documents/CSP_JAB_P-ATO_Prioritization_Criteria_and_Guidance.pdf">JAB Prioritization Criteria and Guidance</a> documentin detail. This document not only describes the prioritization criteria to work with the JAB toward a P-ATO, but also provides all the information needed for a CSP to complete a comprehensive Business Case. 

As a reminder, the PMO is available to have coaching calls with CSPs to discuss their Business Case and provide feedback. If your organization is interested in having one of these calls, please reach out to info@fedramp.gov with some dates and times that work for your team. 

We look forward to reviewing your FedRAMP Connect Business Cases next month!
