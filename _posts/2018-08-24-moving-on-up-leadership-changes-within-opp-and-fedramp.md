The FedRAMP PMO is excited to announce some important leadership changes taking place within the program! As of today, Matt Goodrich, FedRAMP Director, will become the Acting Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Products and Programs (OPP) - the GSA organization within which FedRAMP resides. Additionally, our Evangelist, Ashley Mahan, will fill two roles: Acting FedRAMP Director and Acting Director for the Secure Cloud Portfolio. The latter role will go into effect when Jay Huie - currently serving this role - begins a detail with the White House Leadership Development Program in October.

Matt has worked on FedRAMP as part of the Federal Cloud Computing Initiative since August of 2009, and brings a wealth of experience and deep connections within OPP to this new role. Matt cultivated, grew, and transformed FedRAMP for the past 6 years by engaging with key partners within GSA, across the USG, the White House, industry, and the Hill. Additionally, Matt recently represented OPP during the Boston Consulting Group’s strategic assessment of GSA’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS) and provided valuable insights into how OPP operates and how the office can continue to align strongly with 18F, the Presidential Innovation Fellows, and the Centers of Excellence.

Ashley has been with FedRAMP for over 4 years in a variety of roles - including as a FedRAMP ISSO - and has built strong relationships across government and industry. Her work drives a dramatic increase in FedRAMP adoption, and helps agencies modernize their IT landscapes via cloud technologies. When combined with her natural aptitude for effective and conscious leadership, Ashley is uniquely positioned to continue FedRAMP’s strong growth and continue the work the Cloud Portfolio is doing with the Office of American Innovation in reforming the authorization process across the USG.

The FedRAMP PMO is thrilled for Matt and Ashley. Rest assured that nothing will interrupt or stand in the way of our office continuing to provide the highest quality of responsiveness and service to our customers. Please continue to reach out to the FedRAMP PMO through info@fedramp.gov with any inquiries about this and other topics, and stay tuned for more updates through our blog as we close out this fiscal year and set goals for FY19. 

Thank you for your continued partnership!
