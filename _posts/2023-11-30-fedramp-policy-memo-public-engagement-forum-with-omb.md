The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will be holding a virtual public engagement forum on Xday, November xx, 2023 at xx to read through the <a href="https://www.cio.gov/assets/files/resources/FedRAMP-updated-draft-guidance-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Modernization Memo</a> and answer participant questions to ensure stakeholders are aware of the memo and its contents, and have an opportunity to engage with OMB directly. 

In preparation for the forum, we are asking participants to submit questions they have about the FedRAMP Modernization Memo ahead of time using the <a href="https://app.smartsheetgov.com/b/form/190019cc54ed45c8bdb46ecc91d31c4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">form linked</a> by November XX. During the virtual forum, OMB will first address previously-submitted questions, and will then take additional questions from the audience 

During the meeting, Chatham House Rule for this session will apply, which means the information from the discussion can be used as feedback to OMB, but will not be attributable with names or organizations. To ensure your feedback is captured, we strongly encourage those interested to provide comments <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/27/2023-23839/request-for-comments-on-updated-guidance-for-modernizing-the-federal-risk-authorization-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> thru the Federal Registry.
