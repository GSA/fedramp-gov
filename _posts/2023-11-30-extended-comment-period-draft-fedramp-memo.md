The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) extended the comment period for the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/10/27/office-of-management-and-budget-releases-draft-memorandum-for-modernizing-the-federal-risk-and-authorization-management-program-fedramp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modernizing the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) memo</a> to <b>December 22, 2023</b>.

The FedRAMP PMO firmly believes the government works best when everyone is able to participate and have their voices heard. Recently, Administrator Robin Carnahan, GSAâ€™s top technology officials, and OMB leadership held a Public Engagement Forum on November 15 focused on providing feedback on the memo. For more information about the event, please see the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2023/11/17/gsa-omb-engage-with-stakeholders-on-modernizing-fedramp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSA blog about it here</a>. 

We encourage all of our stakeholders to <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/20/2023-25594/request-for-comments-on-updated-guidance-for-modernizing-the-federal-risk-authorization-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit official comments on the Federal Register site</a> by December 22nd.

Thank you for your thoughtful comments so far and continued engagement with the program.
