One of FedRAMP’s core value propositions is facilitating government-wide reuse of security packages for Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs). Today, more than 175 cloud products are FedRAMP Authorized and are available on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products">FedRAMP Marketplace</a>  for government-wide reuse. Collectively, these products have been reused over 1500 times.

To make this possible, FedRAMP eliminates duplicative efforts by providing a common security framework. Agencies review their security requirements against a standardized baseline. A Cloud Service Provider (CSP) goes through the authorization process once, and after achieving FedRAMP Authorization for their CSO, the security package can be reused by any federal agency. This saves agencies significant time and money when looking for cloud-based products and services. 

FedRAMP developed this quick guide for agencies which outlines how to reuse a security package for a FedRAMP Authorized CSO. When reusing FedRAMP security packages, agencies should keep in mind the following best practices:
* Review and confirm common cloud security baselines
* Understand and implement customer responsibilities
* Send a copy of your ATO for FedRAMP Authorized services to <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a> 

FedRAMP Authorized products all provide the intrinsic benefits of the cloud - remote access, scalability, collaboration efficiency, and many more - that help the federal government achieve its mission and deliver services to the public, and are critical to many agencies’ IT modernization efforts.
