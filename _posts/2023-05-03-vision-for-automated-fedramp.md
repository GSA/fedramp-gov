FedRAMP would like to share our High-Level Automation Strategy for reducing cost and burden for federal government cloud authorizations. FedRAMP automation will enable assessment and continuous monitoring documentation to be more easily shared, processed, and analyzed. This will result in an increased number of CSP authorizations, reduced cost and effort for all stakeholders, faster resolutions for cybersecurity threats, and safer cloud services for the federal government. 

To make the FedRAMP Automation Strategy a reality, data standardization is needed to enable relevant stakeholders to seamlessly share and process documentation. To solve this problem, NIST, in collaboration with FedRAMP, created the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL), a standardized, machine-readable language. OSCAL provides a standardized format that enables stakeholders to create, submit, and ingest common assessment documentation using OSCAL-enabled tools.

FedRAMP envisions that Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) will submit OSCAL-formatted authorization packages and will have automated channels through which continuous monitoring is performed. 

So, what’s the next step?
