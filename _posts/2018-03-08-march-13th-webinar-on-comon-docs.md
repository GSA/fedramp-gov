Earlier this year, we released the updated continuous monitoring (ConMon) documents with the goal of: 

* Improving the overall process and clarify certain elements or expectations
* Making it easier to reference aspects of the process that previously were not documented
* Creating structure in parts of the process that may have been interpreted differently by CSPs and JAB Reviewers

Details outlining these can be found on our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/new-conmon-documents-available/">blog</a> posted on January 31st.

On March 13th from 1-2 pm ET, FedRAMP will be holding a webinar that will provide an overview of the updates made to FedRAMP’s ConMon documents and the new ConMon documents that have been published. You can register for this webinar <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/event/new-release-fedramp-continuous-monitoring-documents/">here.</a>
