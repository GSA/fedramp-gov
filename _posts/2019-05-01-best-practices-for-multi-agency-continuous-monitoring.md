Both Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Federal Agencies play a role in Continuous Monitoring. FedRAMP Authorized CSPs are required to perform Continuous Monitoring to maintain a sufficient security posture. Federal Agencies are obligated to review a CSP’s Continuous Monitoring artifacts to determine if an Authority-to-Operate (ATO) is appropriate over the life of the system. 

Completing Continuous Monitoring and managing multiple ATOs can become challenging when multiple Agencies leverage a common cloud service. In order to help Agencies navigate this process and better perform Continuous Monitoring, FedRAMP published
<a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Guide_for_Multi-Agency_Continuous_Monitoring.pdf">Guidance for Managing Multi-Agency Continuous Monitoring</a>. In this blog post, we walk you through the benefits, best practices, and resources outlined in this guide. 

**Why Multi-Agency Continuous Monitoring?**

Multi-Agency collaboration on Continuous Monitoring benefits participating Agencies by creating a collaborative forum to:
* Enforce a shared responsibility for the security posture of a cloud service
* Shift the evaluation and decision-making regarding a CSP’s security posture from a single leveraging Agency to multiple agencies
* Create a shared understanding of the assessment and evaluation protocol for the ongoing security posture of a cloud service
* Mitigate the inefficiencies of Agencies independently evaluating the ongoing security posture for a commonly leveraged cloud service


**What are Best Practices to Conduct Multi-Agency Continuous Monitoring?**

**1) Establish a Collaboration Group of Agencies Leveraging a Common Cloud Service** 

Collaboration Groups provide a means for Agencies to join together and support one another in a forum for the performance of Continuous Monitoring with a CSP. These groups should be comprised primarily of Agencies leveraging a common cloud service, as well as the CSP. Including a Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) is at the discretion of the CSP, but is encouraged by the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO). 
 
Agencies establishing a Collaboration Group should:
* Ratify a charter that specifies the organization, activities, and governance of the Collaboration Group
* Schedule a regular cadence of meetings (e.g., monthly, quarterly) among Collaboration Group members and the CSP
* Formalize a standard agenda and communication channels for sharing questions, meeting minutes, and decision points across member Agencies
* Define mechanisms for determining a majority vote among member Agencies and processes for member protest, arbitration, and dispute resolution

**2) Define the Common ‘High Water Mark’ a CSP Must Achieve to Address all Participating Agencies’ Requirements**

Collaboration Groups should standardize the Continuous Monitoring requirements that a CSP must meet to streamline the review and approval of a cloud service security posture, including:
* Developing a standard report that summarizes a CSP’s Continuous Monitoring evidence and presents a rolling picture of the service’s security posture 
* Defining common nomenclature and taxonomy for communicating Continuous Monitoring evidence that is agreed upon by member Agencies and the CSP 
* Defining a governance process for the onboarding of new leveraging Agencies and rationalization of Agency-specific requirements relative to the Collaboration Group’s standardized requirements
* If applicable, identify Agency-specific Continuous Monitoring requirements that specific participating Agencies require per FISMA/FITARA

**3) Define a Governance Protocol for the Evaluation, Approval, and Review of Proposed Significant Changes by the CSP**

Evaluation and approval of significant changes is often a sticking point in the management of ATOs for a cloud service across multiple Agencies. Collaboration Groups should consider the following to streamline processes for proposed changes to a cloud service:
* Define a ‘lowest common denominator’ for the qualification of a proposed change by a CSP as a significant change. Ask: *What does each participating Agency consider to be a significant change?*
* Align the group’s significant change protocol to the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Significant-Change-Form-Template.pdf">FedRAMP Significant Change Request Form</a>. Leverage FedRAMP’s <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Significant_Change_Policies_and_Procedures.docx">Significant Change Policy and Procedures</a> 
* Encourage the CSP to clarify the anticipated security impact of a proposed change to current Agency-specific use cases of the cloud service
