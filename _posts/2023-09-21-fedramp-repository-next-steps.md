Starting mid November U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Connect will be the repository solution for FedRAMP document storage and collaboration needs moving forward. This shift is to ensure we maintain the required capability to support FedRAMP customers while the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) MAX system is sunset in December of this year.

<h4>So, what does this mean for users?</h4>
Our aim is that the transition be as seamless as possible for current users as we securely move all customer files and data. We anticipate the user experience will remain much the same as the USDA Connect interface and overall look and feel is similar and will include the same authentication. There will be a few minor changes to the header and users will enter the USDA portal at community.connect.gov instead of the current OMB MAX link.

<h4>Next Steps and Resources</h4>
Our migration efforts will run from November 8 â€“ 12 with minimal disruption. The anticipated go-live date is Monday, November 13. As detailed information and next steps are shared by USDA Connect, FedRAMP will relay relevant data to our users. FedRAMP will also partner with our stakeholders to ensure they are well-prepared for the changes that lie ahead. If you have questions about this transition, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@fedramp.gov</a>. We look forward to partnering and supporting you through this transition.
