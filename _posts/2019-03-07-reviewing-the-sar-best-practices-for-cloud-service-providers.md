Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) pursuing a Low, Moderate, or High FedRAMP authorization are required to partner with a third-party assessment organization (3PAO) to perform an assessment of their cloud service offering. 3PAOs perform comprehensive independent, and objective assessments of a CSP’s service offering and document the results of that assessment in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). While a third-party assessment organization (3PAO) is responsible for generating and delivering the SAR, CSPs have a responsibility to ensure the SAR is completed and all required attachments are provided.

In the PMO’s experience, we have seen errors and inaccuracies in the SAR that significantly impact the timeline and realization of FedRAMP authorization for CSPs.

To inform CSPs’ review of the SAR, the PMO has compiled best practices and probing questions that we encourage CSPs to leverage when reviewing the SAR prior to delivery to the JAB / an Authorizing Official (AO).

**Best Practices for Reviewing the SAR**

* Confirm the [FedRAMP SAR template] (https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-SAR-Template.docx) was used
* Check that system risks are listed and accurately described
* Confirm the 3PAO has accurately described mitigating factors and compensating controls for all risk adjustments and operational requirements
* Ensure the following documentation is included with the SAR and FedRAMP templates are used, where applicable:
  <p> [SAR Appendix A - Risk Exposure Table] (https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SAR-AA-FedRAMP-Risk-Exposure-Table-Template.xlsx) </p>
 <p>  [SAP Appendix A - Test Case Procedures] (https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SAP-AA-FedRAMP-Moderate-Security-Test-Case-Procedures-Template.xlsx) </p>
 <p>  Vulnerability scan results are in line with FedRAMP scanning [guidance] (https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Vulnerability_Scanning_Requirements.pdf) </p>
* Validate that the assessment methodology described in SAR Section 3 aligns with the methodology described in the Security Assessment Plan (SAP)
* Validate that any sampling methodologies used for the purpose of assessment are described (if applicable)
* Check that the SAR includes a 3PAO attestation statement and recommendation for authorization for the system

**Probing Questions for Reviewing the SAR**

Documentation
* _Are all documents in FedRAMP templates?_
* _Are all document artifacts complete?_
* _Are all ancillary SAR documents included with the SAR?_

System Risks

* _Are unique risks individually identified and labelled?_
* _Are risks described to a level of detail that could be understood by the JAB / AO?_
* _Are HIGH findings identified and provided along with comments?_
* _Are downgraded risks listed, described, and include a description of the mitigating factor(s)?_
 
Consistency

* _Are the inventory lists in the SAR consistent with the lists provided in the SSP?_
* _Are the Assessment Results described in Appendix F consistent with the [Risk Exposure Table] (https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SAR-AA-FedRAMP-Risk-Exposure-Table-Template.xlsx) (SAR Section 4 and Appendix A)?_
* _Are document / system versions consistently stated within the SAR?_
 
**Agency Authorization: SAR Debriefs** 

The PMO recommends a SAR debrief for all CSPs pursuing Agency authorization. Designed to inform stakeholders on the results of assessment, a SAR debrief allows the 3PAO to present its assessment findings to the Agency customer and PMO. Debriefs also allow the CSP to communicate its remediation plan to the Agency customer and PMO.

We hope these best practices inform CSP’s review of their SAR. CSPs interested in scheduling a SAR debrief should reach out to agency@fedramp.gov or their existing FedRAMP point of contact.

Additional questions or comments can be provided to FedRAMP at info@fedramp.gov.
