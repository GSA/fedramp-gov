Throughout the week of November 16, 2020, the FedRAMP PMO held a virtual, 3PAO Interact, to bring FedRAMP recognized 3PAOs (Third Party Assessment Organizations) together to share information and hear feedback about the program. 3PAOs play a critical role for FedRAMP by ensuring cloud systems meet FedRAMP security requirements as part of a Cloud Service Provider’s (CSPs) FedRAMP authorization. 

During the week, the PMO hosted presentations, panels, listening sessions, and training to provide a learning opportunity for our 3PAO stakeholders to engage with FedRAMP. In addition, FedRAMP hosted small group discussions to hear from 3PAOs on what’s working well and what could be improved in certain areas of the program. Topics covered included: Readiness Assessments, Technical Guidance, and Authorization Boundary and Data Flow Diagrams.

Attendee feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and there were several requests for more events throughout the year. Many thanks to the 100+ participants from over 30 different organizations for attending. 

The FedRAMP PMO is committed to supporting all of our stakeholders and looks forward to hosting more events and trainings in 2021.
