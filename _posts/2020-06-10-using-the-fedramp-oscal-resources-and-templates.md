The FedRAMP PMO, in collaboration with NIST, is working to digitize the authorization package through the development of a common machine-readable language, also known as the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL). 

With OSCAL, activities associated with preparing, authorizing, and reusing cloud products and services will require less time and resources. As a result of a machine-readable authorization package, we anticipate several impacts, such as:
* **Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)** will be able to create their System Security Plans (SSPs) more rapidly and accurately, validating much of their content before submission to the government for review.
* **Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)** will be able to automate the planning, execution, and reporting of cloud assessment activities.
* **Agencies** will be able to expedite their reviews of the FedRAMP security authorization packages.

**OSCAL Short Video** 

The FedRAMP PMO developed a short video that discusses high-level OSCAL goals, applications, and how to use the FedRAMP OSCAL SSP template and other resources.
