On March 25th, FedRAMP hosted its fourth Agency Information System Security Officer (ISSO) training. This training was a huge success, drawing over 90 Information Security Professionals from over 30 Federal Agencies. Thank you to everyone who took time out of their day to join us. 

The training provided a collaborative space for ISSOs to review, understand, and discuss best practices and approaches to FedRAMP Agency Authorizations. 

The training was part of FedRAMP’s larger effort to partner with and empower Federal Agencies to issue FedRAMP Authorizations to Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). The Agency ISSO plays a critical role in an Agency’s journey to procure secure cloud technology. ISSOs are the first members of the Agency team that review the associated FedRAMP deliverables to ensure their federal data would be protected within any given cloud environment. FedRAMP is taking a proactive and focused approach in training Agency ISSOs on the FedRAMP Authorization process. 

FedRAMP Director Ashley Mahan opened the training by welcoming participants and sharing her vision and outcomes for the day including: 
<p>
1) Establishing a shared understanding of the FedRAMP recommendations 
  </p>
  <p>
2) Increasing awareness of standard practices and approaches for a FedRAMP Authorization
  </p>
  <p>
3) Clarifying common challenges and hurdles related to Agency FedRAMP Authorizations 
</p>
The training focused on the various phases of the Agency Authorization process and how Agencies can efficiently reuse authorization packages, as outlined in “<a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Authorization_Playbook.pdf">FedRAMP’s Agency Authorization Playbook</a>.” FedRAMP Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from the PMO and across the USG also provided a “deep dive” on FedRAMP deliverables, exchanged lessons learned, and identified best-practices to aid ISSOs in their review. 

The next training will take place in Summer 2019. We look forward to hosting this event again to help educate the FedRAMP Agency Community.
