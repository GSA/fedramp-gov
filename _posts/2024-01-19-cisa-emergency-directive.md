On Friday, January 19, 2024, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/emergency-directive-xx-xx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergency Directive 24-01</a>, “Mitigate Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Vulnerabilities” (the Emergency Directive). The Emergency Directive states the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><em>CISA has observed widespread, active exploitation of vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) appliances. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities will allow an attacker to move laterally, perform data exfiltration, and establish persistent system access resulting in full system compromise.  

CISA has determined the presence of these vulnerabilities pose an unacceptable risk to Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies and requires emergency action. This determination is based on the widespread exploitation of these vulnerabilities by multiple threat actors, the prevalence of the affected software in the federal enterprise, the high potential for a compromise of agency information systems, the potential impact of a successful compromise and the complexity of the proposed mitigations.</em></p>

<h3>Actions Required</h3>
In consultation with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and DHS CISA, FedRAMP emphasizes that Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) who maintain federal information fall within the scope defined by <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/emergency-directive-xx-xx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergency Directive 24-01</a>.

When these actions are complete, we request that you:

- Email the FedRAMP PMO with notification of the completed action at info@fedramp.gov using the following convention for your subject line: <em>(CSP NAME | Package ID)</em> - Response to ED 24-01
- Upload a copy of your Email notification to the incident response folder in your respective FedRAMP secure repository

If any indication of compromise or anomalous behavior is found or there is any suspected impact to federal systems, please make sure to follow the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Incident_Communications_Procedures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Incident Communication Procedures</a>, which includes reporting to CISA US-CERT and agency customers (including JAB POC, if applicable).
