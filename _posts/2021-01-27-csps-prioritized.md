- Absolute Software - Absolute Platform
- Citrix Systems - Citrix Workspace
- RSA - RSA SecurID Access
- Zoom Video Communications - Zoom for Government

These CSPs were selected in accordance with our JAB Prioritization Guidance and Criteria document and will work with the JAB on their security package reviews. We’re proud to see the scope and scale of innovation and infrastructure modernization that this next group of vendors represent for JAB authorizations. Congratulations!
