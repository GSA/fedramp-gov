The story last year for FedRAMP was one of change, including the end of the Joint Authorization Board, the release of the [White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-24-15](https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-07-26-the-next-phase-of-fedramp/), the creation of the FedRAMP Board and the Technical Advisory Group, and a strong vision for the future of FedRAMP.

<h3>FedRAMP is delivering on that vision by:</h3>
<h4>1. Updating policies and public comment:</h4> We’ve shifted to a more aggressive cadence for releasing draft updates for policies and directives that will affect cloud service providers. We expect to see Requests for Comment (RFC) become a routine activity, with multiple RFCs open at any given time as FedRAMP continuously works to improve. We added a [Policy and Guidance Updates page](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/policy-and-guidance/) to our website that reflects the current status of policy and guidance that has been released recently or is expected to be released soon.

<b><a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/docs/cryptographic-module/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryptographic Module Selection Policy - published</a></b>
This policy provides guidance on navigating competing requirements for the use of FIPS-140 validated cryptographic modules and to remediate known vulnerabilities. The policy takes a risk-based approach and prioritizes the application of updates to remediate known vulnerabilities that can pose immediate risk to federal information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 0rem; padding-left:32px;">
<b>Boundary Guidance  - RFC Published</b>
This draft policy opens discussion on clarifications for the documentation and assessment of the FedRAMP boundary and the reuse of FedRAMP authorized cloud service offerings services by cloud service providers. The draft policy defines the FedRAMP boundary as all services that handle federal information, or directly impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal information.</p>

<h4>2. Demonstrating progress:</h4> All priority FedRAMP initiatives now have dedicated sections on our website that will be updated regularly. We’ve also created a simple changelog page that we’ll continue to maintain as initiatives advance, announcements are made, or other significant changes happen within the program.

<h4>3. Developing in the open:</h4> FedRAMP’s developer team is hard at work enhancing the data, documentation, and tools to make digital authorization package submissions with [the FedRAMP Platform](https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-09-03-the-missing-piece-of-our-modernization-puzzle-the-fedramp-platform/) possible. The team runs several industry engagement touchpoints, including bi-weekly OSCAL Implementers meetings for [the Digital Authorization Pilot;](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/pilots/digital-authorization-package/) monthly briefings on all the automation initiatives; ad-hoc office hour sessions with developers; and troubleshoots real-time GitHub requests from the developer community.

<h3>In case you missed it</h3>
Operating in the open with a focus on delivery means we’ve been publishing some key content (even over the holidays!) as quickly as possible without a lot of fanfare. That’s why we want to highlight our new [Requests for Comment (RFC) landing page](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/rfcs/) and all the activity happening around our work towards improving FedRAMP policies and directives. We need your insight to ensure our changes have the greatest benefit with the least operational impact. Here’s what you can review and comment on today:

- [RFC0001: A New Comment Process for FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/rfcs/0001/) - we’re piloting the use of informal discussion forums in addition to the more formal letter-style submission process. 
- [RFC0002: Proposed Revisions to FedRAMP 3PAO Requirements](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/rfcs/0002/) - we listened to a bunch of pain points from independent assessors and are proposing changes to address them. Are we on the right track?
- [RFC0003: Review Initiation Checks (RICs)](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/rfcs/0003/) - if a CSP had a (relatively) simple checklist they could follow to likely receive FedRAMP authorization on the first review… would they use it? You tell us.

Want to share your thoughts and experiences on something else? You can always reach out directly to the FedRAMP Director at [pete@fedramp.gov](mailto:pete@fedramp.gov) with a note or ask to schedule a chat.
