Over the past few months, we’ve been working to reframe how we prioritize vendors that work with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) through a more transparent and public process. We worked closely with the CIO Council and OMB to develop a new approach through an initiative called **FedRAMP Connect** to select Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) based on demand and a set of preferential criteria (we previously shared this approach in a blog post: [JAB and Prioritization Criteria and Process](https://www.fedramp.gov/fedramp-jab-prioritization-criteria-and-process/)).

We received roughly 40 FedRAMP Business Cases from CSPs requesting prioritization for a JAB P-ATO. After evaluating the business cases and conducting a review with the JAB, the list was narrowed down to 14 CSPs to participate in **FedRAMP Connect**. On February 27th we held the inaugural **FedRAMP Connect** with the JAB representatives and 13 different agency CIOs and their representatives from across the government.

Each vendor presenting at **FedRAMP Connect** pitched services to detail their governmentwide demand, applicability for cross-agency use, and the security of their system. After a full evaluation by the JAB and 13 agency representatives, the following seven were chosen to work with the JAB:

* Accenture Federal Services - Accenture Insights Platform

* Apptio - Apptio, Inc.

* Box - Box Enterprise Cloud Content Collaboration Platform (high impact)

* Google - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

* Axon - Axon Evidence.com

* XTEC - AuthentX Cloud Service Offering (AuthentX CSO) (high impact)

* SAP National Security Services (NS2) - SuccessFactors Suite for Federal


We’re incredibly excited to work with these vendors and kickoff over the coming weeks and months.

Additionally, after a successful initial run, we plan to make **FedRAMP**** _Connect_** a biannual event that expands the marketplace of FedRAMP authorized services by providing a space for industry to connect with CIOs and Agency buyers that are in need of authorized cloud services. We’ve learned a number of lessons from this first round of work with CSPs and we want to thank everyone for their involvement and partnership.

Keep an eye out for future blogs about our next round of **FedRAMP** **_Connect_** towards the end of summer and the new version of the FedRAMP Business Case. We’re also planning to release a White Paper on FedRAMP Accelerated in the coming weeks which shares the story of the recent JAB authorization redesign. If you have any questions in the meantime on how to get involved, please e-mail [info@fedramp.gov](mailto:info@fedramp.gov) for more information.
