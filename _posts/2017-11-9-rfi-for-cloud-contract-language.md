In an effort to help agencies continue to adopt secure cloud technologies, FedRAMP has been identifying ways to create standard contract language that agencies can use in their acquisition process as they procure cloud-based products. FedRAMP, along with the GSA Secure Cloud Portfolio, is requesting industry feedback regarding the acquisition process and how agencies include cloud, FedRAMP, and other security requirements in their contracts. This feedback will allow us to continue to provide improved guidance for government acquisition officials and contracting professionals. To provide your feedback, please access the Request for Information (RFI) and provide comments on GitHub [here](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp/blob/master/rfi-directory/contract_language.md).

The information gathered in this RFI will help identify examples of preferred contract language agencies should incorporate to convey FedRAMP requirements in their solicitations. These examples will be used to generate guidance and education for agencies.

We look forward to hearing your input!
