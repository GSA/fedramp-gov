The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will be holding a virtual public engagement forum on Wednesday, November 15, 2023 at 12pm EST to read through the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FedRAMP-updated-draft-guidance-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Modernization Memo</a> and answer participant questions. The goal of this forum is to ensure stakeholders become more familiar with the memo and its contents, and have an opportunity to engage with OMB directly.

The FedRAMP PMO is committed to stakeholder feedback and will be hosting this meeting to give our stakeholders the opportunity to engage in direct dialogue with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

This event is not intended to replace the open comment period in the Federal Register, but to encourage dialogue around the policy memo so OMB gets more and better feedback from FedRAMP stakeholders. To ensure your feedback is officially captured, we strongly encourage stakeholders to provide comments <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/27/2023-23839/request-for-comments-on-updated-guidance-for-modernizing-the-federal-risk-authorization-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> through the Federal Register - open until November 27, 2023.
