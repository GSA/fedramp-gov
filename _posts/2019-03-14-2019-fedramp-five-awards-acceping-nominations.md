We are pleased to announce our second annual “FedRAMP Five” awards to celebrate our government partners who have helped FedRAMP grow, develop, and improve over time. FedRAMP’s success depends on our partners across the U.S. government, and we thrive as a program because of the outstanding involvement and commitment from our Agency teammates. 

In FY19, the FedRAMP PMO is focused on TLC: Technology, Learning, and Customers. In that spirit, we hope to use these awards as an opportunity to provide recognition to our agency customers and highlight how their support has helped the FedRAMP program grow and succeed. The FedRAMP Five awards - named after the five categories of award - is our way of saying “thank you!”

The FedRAMP Five Awards will be given in the following five categories:
