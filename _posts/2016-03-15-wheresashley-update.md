FedRAMP’s Agency Evangelist, Ashley Mahan, has been very busy over the past month speaking to Agencies, CSPs, 3PAOs and the public as part of both the Agency Roadshow and #WheresAshley campaigns. In fact, she’s met with individuals from State, HHS, HUD, DOC, DOJ, NASA, NSF, GSA, Federal Reserve, Treasury, FAA, IRS, FCC, Accenture, Amazon, Avue, BMC, Cisco, Coalfire, Collab9, Companion Data Services, General Dynamics, KnightPoint, Microsoft, NetComm, Skyhigh Networks, Veris and Lunarline. And that’s just in the last 30 days!

In these meetings Ashley provides education about cloud computing, US government security requirements and FedRAMP while also promoting cross-government partnership and fostering a government-wide community around cloud.

Ashley’s goal is to create a uniform understanding of FedRAMP across the Federal government and increase the adoption of cloud and FedRAMP at the same time. Here are some key takeaways from Ashley’s most recent chats on her campaigns:

* Agencies are moving more and more core agency functions to the cloud in order to benefit from the cost savings of cloud.

* Agencies like the unified framework of FedRAMP for how security is completed, but have gaps in understanding how to fully utilize FedRAMP at their agency.

* Establishing a POC for FedRAMP at each agency is  critical as FedRAMP moves forward to help agencies work together with FedRAMP , both on authorizations and leveraging authorizations from the JAB or other agencies.


Ashley visits several Federal agencies each week , if she hasn’t visited you and you want to meet, reach out to her at [agency@FedRAMP.gov](mailto:agency@fedramp.gov). These key takeaways above are just the beginning and your agency meeting with Ashley will help shape how Ashley engages with agencies and how she can help move adoption of FedRAMP further. You can follow her adventures on Twitter at [@FedRAMPAshley](https://twitter.com/fedrampashley) and the hashtags #AgencyRoadshow and #WheresAshley.
