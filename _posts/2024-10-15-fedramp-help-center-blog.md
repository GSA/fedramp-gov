<h4>The FedRAMP Help Center</h4>

Navigating the complex landscape of cloud security and FedRAMP requirements can be challenging for agencies, cloud service providers (CSPs), third party assessment organizations (3PAOs), acquisition professionals, and other stakeholders. To address this need for additional support, we are launching the <a href="https://help.fedramp.gov/hc/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new FedRAMP Help Center</a>.

The FedRAMP Help Center serves as a centralized repository of information, tools, and resources designed to improve the understanding of FedRAMP for acquisition professionals, cloud service providers, 3PAOs, and agencies. The goal is to provide these stakeholders  with the knowledge they need to understand their role in the FedRAMP ecosystem and effectively address their questions.

<h4>What’s available in the FedRAMP Help Center</h4>

We’re offering several valuable resources within the Help Center:

1. **Knowledge Base Guides and Technical Articles:** Our knowledge base features quick guides that walk you through aspects of the FedRAMP process and controls, while our technical articles focus on areas identified by stakeholders as challenging. Written in plain language, these guides and articles ensure both technical and non-technical audiences can grasp key concepts and collaborate effectively.

2. **Best Practices:** The Help Center will keep you informed with regular updates on FedRAMP policies, clarification of security requirements, and emerging best practices. Our aim is to help you maintain a stronger security posture and stay ahead of potential risks.

3. **FAQs:** Our FAQ section covers a wide range of common queries, and the FAQ content from the main website will be seamlessly integrated into the Help Center to make it easier to maintain, search, link, and review.

4. **Definitions and Acronyms:** The Help Center includes a curated glossary of FedRAMP-specific  terms and acronyms, helping to demystify the language of the program.
