Fedramp's vision for automated and data driven risk management has achieved a key milestone with the completed acquisition of the platform that will drive our automation efforts. This cutting-edge solution is set to transform the authorization review process, enabling efficient collaboration with our cloud service, agency, and automation tool-provider stakeholders, and automation throughout the entire lifecycle of cloud service authorizations.

<h4>We need diverse viewpoints and perspectives</h4>

FedRAMP will host small focus groups for agencies, current and prospective cloud service providers, and independent assessors in support of our configuration of the platform. Please complete this <a href="https://app.smartsheetgov.com/b/form/bf8b558127c147c58b38598e4ca6ba8f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">form</a> by September 15, 2024, if you would like to participate. We are particularly seeking individuals with visual or hearing impairments or upper-motor disabilities to participate in this work. Your insights will be invaluable in testing and refining our 508 compliance capabilities, ensuring that our platform is accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

<h4>Technology enabling change</h4>

This platform will enable change by providing:

- Smart systems that make getting and using FedRAMP authorizations easier through automated workflows that provide a digital and streamlined authorization experience.
- Expanded continuous monitoring capabilities to ensure that systems remain secure and can shift to automated and continuous assessment, while empowering agencies and risk managers with data to make authorization decisions.
- Enhanced collaboration and communication capabilities that enable centralized real time feedback, actionable data, and minimizes miscommunication.
- Better metrics across the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Marketplace</a>, including allowing FedRAMP to track and improve the customer experience and drive improved security outcomes. 

As a result of this modernization, our Marketplace trust will be stronger and authorization and continuous monitoring will result in better security outcomes.
