Have insights on cloud acquisitions language? FedRAMP is interested in hearing your thoughts!

In service of helping agencies adopt secure cloud technologies, the FedRAMP PMO has been working to create standard contract language for agencies to use as they acquire secure cloud-based products. Weâ€™re seeking your feedback on how agencies can include cloud, FedRAMP, and other security requirements in their contracts.

Your insights will help us identify examples of preferred contract language that agencies should incorporate to convey FedRAMP requirements in their solicitations, and ultimately improve guidance for government acquisition officials and contracting professionals.

**If you would like to provide your feedback, please access the Request for Information (RFI) [here](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=cfb9700d40f88c42086645951550eafe&tab=core&_cview=0) and comment on GitHub [here](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp/blob/master/rfi-directory/contract_language.md) by COB December 15th.**

We appreciate your time and effort and we look forward to your responses!
