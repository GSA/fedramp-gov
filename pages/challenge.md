<h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
<p>Although more Agencies than ever now adopt secure cloud technologies, challenges remain. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) strives to continuously improve how we support our customers. In an effort to enhance and evolve our program, the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) seeks to leverage the power and insights of the cybersecurity community. Respondents have the opportunity to help guide what the PMO takes on next and ensure that the government keeps federal data secure while bolstering modernization efforts.</p>

<h3>GOAL</h3>
<p>Participants should submit bold, innovative, and actionable ideas that offer a new perspective on topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>FedRAMP’s processes;</li>
<li>Policy and guidance;</li>
<li>Standards of operation; and </li>
<li>New ways to maintain or improve the security rigor vital to protect federal and public data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security and cloud professionals, academia, and anyone interested or involved in the FedRAMP ecosystem are invited to participate in this opportunity to share their best thinking on the next phase of FedRAMP.</p>

<h3>OPPORTUNITY</h3>
<p>FedRAMP is the security framework by which cloud computing solutions are authorized to operate in the government environment. We strive to continuously improve our processes to best deliver secure cloud solutions for Agency use, as well as reuse, in shorter time-frames than ever before. Still, we know that our community’s collective brainpower can unlock even more.</p>
<p>As technology evolves and advances, the amount and complexity of data that the government ingests, manages, and must secure is growing. Implementing security effectively is expensive and time consuming, but the cost and risk for not adhering to rigorous security can be exponentially more costly. Cloud is an ever-changing environment, and with an evolving technology landscape comes increased threat. FedRAMP wants to ensure that it is improving and evolving in step with industry, and making every effort to reduce the time, cost, and complexity of the authorization process while never compromising rigor.</p>
<p>This challenge provides FedRAMP’s stakeholders and the cloud security community at large the opportunity to directly inform the Federal Government’s current approach to cloud security authorizations.</p>

<h3>BACKGROUND</h3><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/background-icon.png">
</span>
<p>Before FedRAMP, each Agency established their own set of security controls that industry providers had to adhere to -  these controls changed from one federal Agency to the next. There was no information sharing regarding security from one Agency to another, and each vendor had to comply with disparate, sometimes overlapping requirements. FedRAMP created security baselines for government that allowed industry to meet one set of security requirements, and the government to “re-use” key security information. This standardized approach enables Agencies to rapidly adapt from old, insecure legacy IT to mission-enabling, secure, and cost effective cloud-based IT. FedRAMP is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. The FedRAMP process is based on the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/risk-management-framework-(RMF)-Overview" target="_blank">NIST RMF</a> and our security controls are based on <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-53r4.pdf" target="_blank">NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 baselines</a>, and contain controls above the NIST baseline that address the unique elements of cloud computing.</p>

<p>In an effort to improve how CSPs, Agencies, and 3PAOs experience FedRAMP, the PMO has implemented past initiatives to improve the program, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Accelerated_A_Case_Study_For_Change_Within_Government.pdf">FedRAMP Accelerated</a></li>
<li><a href="/pursuing-a-fedramp-ready-designation/">FedRAMP Ready</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Authorization_Playbook.pdf">Agency Authorization Playbook</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Authorization_Playbook_Getting_Started_with_FedRAMP.pdf">CSP Authorization Playbook</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/resources/documents/CSP_JAB_P-ATO_Prioritization_Criteria_and_Guidance.pdf">FedRAMP Connect</a></li>
<li><a href="/pursuing-a-fedramp-tailored-authorization/">FedRAMP Tailored Li-SaaS Baseline</a></li>
</ul>
<p>FedRAMP’s current change-based priorities include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Automating the drafting, analysis, and review of FedRAMP security documentation to reduce time and cost to authorize cloud services</li>
<li>Developing and promoting a modular, prioritized process for authorization of cloud technologies to reduce time and cost</li>
<li>Improving Agencies’ expertise in cloud cybersecurity through continued training activities, including in-person and on-demand Agency training, self-service modules, as well as pursuing a rotational Agency detailee training program at the FedRAMP PMO</li>
<li>Exploring reciprocity across markets by reviewing other industry security programs and frameworks to identify opportunities to partner</li>
</ul>

<h3>THE CURRENT FEDRAMP PROCESS</h3><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/process-icon.png">
</span>
<p>Through the FedRAMP PMO’s conversations with agencies and industry, there are challenges we continually hear from our customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vendors say it takes too long, is complex, and expensive</li>
<li>Agencies are hesitant to reuse FedRAMP Authorizations and require additional security requirements in addition to the FedRAMP baseline</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, CSPs can achieve a FedRAMP Authorization from one of two approaches: through Agency partnership or through the Joint Authorization Board (JAB). Regardless of the authorization approach, the CSP and 3PAO must produce the same deliverables (documents, artifacts, and evidence files) to convey the risk associated with the cloud service offering. </p>

	<h3>SUBMISSION DETAILS</h3><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/submissiondetails-icon.png">
	</span>
<p>	Challenge participants are encouraged to submit any idea that could improve and benefit the FedRAMP program for any part of the cloud security authorization process. No idea is too small! </p>
