<p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. </p>
<p><strong>FedRAMP enables Agencies to rapidly adapt from old, insecure legacy IT to mission-enabling, secure, and cost effective cloud-based IT. </strong></p>
<p>FedRAMP created and manages a core set of processes to ensure effective, repeatable cloud security for the government. FedRAMP established a mature marketplace to increase utilization and familiarity with cloud services while facilitating collaboration across government through open exchanges of lessons learned, use cases, and tactical solutions. </p>

<h2>FedRAMP Authorizations </h2>
<p>If you have a Cloud Service Offering (CSO) that is in use by the federal government, you should be thinking about obtaining a FedRAMP authorization. Per an <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf">OMB memorandum</a>, any cloud services that hold federal data must be FedRAMP authorized. There are two ways to authorize a cloud service through FedRAMP: a Joint Authorization Board (JAB) provisional authorization (P-ATO), and through individual Agencies. Learn more about these authorizations on our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/jab-authorization">JAB Authorization</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/agency-authorization">Agency Authorization</a> pages.
