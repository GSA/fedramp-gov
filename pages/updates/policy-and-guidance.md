_**2024-11-07 Please Note:** This page needs a look-and-feel update that may
take some time, but FedRAMP is making the information available in a rudimentary
form now rather than waiting. Thank you for your patience with the formatting._

FedRAMP is fostering transparency for its policy and guidance development
efforts. This page reflects the current status of policy and guidance that has
been released recently or is expected to be released soon. Public feedback is
welcome anytime at info@fedramp.gov.

## In Development

The following documents are under active development and have not yet been
published for public comment.

- **Review Initiation Criteria (RIC)** - These guidelines help CSPs, IAs, and
  federal agency partners evaluate and verify the completeness, consistency,
  accuracy, and clarity of an authorization package. It is being developed to
  highlight and address key areas of common package quality issues identified
  during FedRAMP reviews that often lead to the need for package changes by the
  CSP and IAs before resubmission and rereview of the package. By clearly
  identifing the causes of these passbacks, FedRAMP hopes to speed up initial
  reviews, reduce passbacks/resubmissions, and ultimately reduce authorization
  timelines by setting CSPs up for success early in the process.

- **Authorization Boundary Guidance update**

- **Program authorization approach**

- **3PAO a2la training requirements**
