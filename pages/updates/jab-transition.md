summary: Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Transition
---

In 2022 Congress passed the
[FedRAMP Authorization Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr7776/BILLS-117hr7776enr.pdf#page=1055)
which required the establishment of a FedRAMP Board, replacing the JAB, to
oversee the overall health and performance of FedRAMP and work within the
federal community to expand the authorization capacity of the FedRAMP ecosystem.
The Act also required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to
[issue guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/M-24-15-Modernizing-the-Federal-Risk-and-Authorization-Management-Program.pdf)
to accelerate the adoption of secure cloud products and services across the
Federal government. Together, these began a series of shifts that are altering
the way FedRAMP operates as a program.

Historically, the JAB, consisting of the Chief Information Officers of the
Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the
General Services Administration (GSA), along with their technical
representatives, approved cloud service offerings for FedRAMP authorization and
monitored the security of offerings it authorized.

Today, the JAB is no longer monitoring cloud services as a unified entity or
authorizing new cloud services. FedRAMP is providing the coordination for both
the systems previously prioritized for potential JAB Authorization and the
previously Authorized JAB Systems.

Transparency is important as work continues with the JAB transition. The overall
plan is documented in more detail below. Progress will be updated regularly.

## Systems Previously Prioritized for Potential JAB Authorization

FedRAMP is committed to ensuring the previously prioritized systems have a
pathway to authorization. Thirteen cloud service offerings (CSO) were
prioritized for review by the JAB. Of the 13 CSOs in the JAB queue, ten are
continuing to pursue authorization. All of these systems have:

- completed FedRAMP Readiness assessments that align with previous JAB
  standards;
- been assessed by FedRAMP-recognized 3PAOs; and
- a complete security package ready to review for authorization.

First, FedRAMP is working with these CSOs to find partner federal agencies. In
addition, FedRAMP is developing a new program authorization path and the
capacity to perform program authorizations. Since our
[August blog post](https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-08-12-moving-to-one-fedramp-authorization-an-update-on-the-jab-transition/),
FedRAMP has worked with one CSO who received authorization and has supported
multiple in obtaining agency partners.

## Previously Authorized JAB Systems

FedRAMP is taking a two-phased approach to transition oversight for the 58
formerly JAB Authorized systems to the DOD, DHS, GSA, FedRAMP or agency
customers:

- **Phase I:**

  - Ia: Identify new designated lead agencies from DOD, DHS, GSA, or FedRAMP.
    (Complete)
  - Ib: 30 day transition period for each system. (In Process)

- **Phase II:**
  - IIa: Work with agency customers to ensure enrollment in continuous
    monitoring activities.
  - IIb: Re-assign designated leads for CSOs initially designated to FedRAMP to
    agency customers

Continuous monitoring responsibilities include reviewing monthly POA&M,
Inventory and Vulnerability Scan submissions, reviewing Significant Change
Requests, and reviewing and approving Annual Assessments. FedRAMP will continue
to work with these formerly JAB Authorized CSPs to create the one-page system
overview document that all these systems previously delivered under the JAB.

### Phase I

Phase I of the transition began in late October of 2024 and will run through
December 2024 lasting a minimum of 30 days for each CSO. During this phase, we
assigned designated lead agencies from one of the former JAB agencies or FedRAMP
that aligns with the agency currently using the system while transitioning off
the former JAB reviewers.

A
[designation letter](/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-JAB-Transition-Designation-Letter-Template.pdf)
for each system enumerates the designated lead’s responsibilities and will be
uploaded to each system’s continuous monitoring folder in their respective
secure repository. FedRAMP will continue to process one-page continuous
monitoring summaries for each of these systems for up to one year from the
transition date. Once a system transitions, the former P-ATO letters will
terminate. A comprehensive list of the formerly 58 JAB authorized systems can be
found below.

### Phase II

After the initial 30-day transition – and with FedRAMP’s support – designated
lead agencies will set up multi-agency continuous monitoring. Customer agencies
are encouraged to join continuous monitoring meetings with the CSPs to allow for
more transparency and a deeper understanding of the continuous monitoring
activities. If you are an agency using, or interested in using, one of these
systems and would like to be involved in continuous monitoring activities,
please contact the email address on the signed designation letter for that CSP.

For systems transitioned to DOD, DHS, and GSA, the newly designated lead agency
will be the primary on continuous monitoring activities going forward. FedRAMP
will validate that designated lead agencies and cloud providers have set up
collaborative continuous monitoring, ensuring agency visibility into the
security posture of the system, and a central forum for addressing questions for
the cloud provider.

For systems that were initially transitioned to FedRAMP, we will be contacting
agency customers to identify a new designated lead. FedRAMP cannot support
continuous monitoring for all of these systems, so agency participation will be
required to ensure the continuous monitoring and oversight of these systems
going forward.
