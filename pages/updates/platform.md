# Status

In Development

# Description

The Platform is for FedRAMP, agencies, cloud service providers, and third party assessment organization (3PAO) staff to collaborate on digital authorization packages and continuous monitoring data in a unified portal. Moving forward, FedRAMP will facilitate interactions with these stakeholders in the portal using the Platformâ€™s web interface or automated workflows via application programming interfaces (APIs). This approach will make authorizations easier, expand continuous monitoring capabilities, enhance communication between stakeholders, and facilitate tracking and publishing metrics transparently.

FedRAMP is actively working with our stakeholders, using a human-centered design approach, to incrementally design, test, and deploy the FedRAMP Platform. You can learn more about the journey, our progress, and key milestones below.
