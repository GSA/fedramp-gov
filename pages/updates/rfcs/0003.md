## Summary

FedRAMP Review Initiation Checks (RICs) provide cloud service providers,
independent assessors, and federal agencies with checklists to ensure an
authorization package is complete and ready for FedRAMP review. These optional
checklists highlight the most frequently misunderstood and/or commonly
incomplete aspects of a package that regularly require rework from a cloud
service provider after initial review by FedRAMP. Following the RICs at the
appropriate time will require additional up front effort by the cloud service
provider and is thus entirely optional, but packages submitted with a completed
set of RICs are far more likely to pass initial review and reduce rework.

## Motivation

Preparing all of the documentation and materials required to complete a FedRAMP
authorization package is a difficult and complex task. Initial reviews by
FedRAMP often uncover common issues that slow down review or require significant
rework and re-review, often months after the package has been submitted to
FedRAMP due to the size of the FedRAMP review backlog.

We anticipate that having an explicit checklist for cloud service providers to
review the completeness and readiness of their package when they have completed
major phases of work will improve the consistency of FedRAMP reviews and reduce
the frequency of re-reviews required. This will increase the speed of
authorization and reduce the overall effort for cloud service providers who
follow the checklists.

These checklists can also inform business decisions on readiness and progress in
a slightly more consumable format that the package documentation itself.

## Explanation

There are two draft checklists available for review and feedback:

## Discussion Requested

These Review Initiation Checks are optional tools for cloud service providers to
reduce the overall burden of preparing packages for FedRAMP authorization. If
the RICs are successful at improving initial package consistency and reducing
re-review, FedRAMP may prioritize cloud service offerings in the backlog based
on use of the RICs by the cloud service provider.

FedRAMP is open to all comments on the proposed RICs but is especially
interested in understanding if they are sufficiently clear and concise for use
or what improvements are necessary to ensure they can be. FedRAMP does not
intend to require use of the RICs and would also like to understand if optional
supporting processes like this are useful to cloud service providers.

# RFC-0003 - Review Initiation Check (RIC) Part 1: Pre-Assessment
# **Overview**

Optional FedRAMP Review Initiation Checks (RIC) help cloud service providers, independent assessors, and federal agency partners understand how FedRAMP evaluates and verifies the completeness, consistency, accuracy, and clarity of an authorization package. Following these checks properly will enable expedited review by FedRAMP and increase the likelihood of a smooth FedRAMP authorization process.

* **RIC Part 1** may be used by the cloud service provider to self-assess after the preparation of the System Security Plan but prior to the independent security assessment of the cloud service offering. 

* **RIC Part 2** may be used by the cloud service provider to self-assess after the completion of the independent security assessment of the cloud service offering and after the preparation of the Security Assessment Plan and Security Assessment Report.

This document contains the RIC Part 1\.

# **RIC Part 1**

The cloud service provider performs the Part 1 checks on the System Security Plan and related attachments/appendices prior to the initial assessment. Each item within each check will generate one of the following results:

* Yes, indicating that this item is fully met  
* No, indicating that this item is applicable but is not fully met  
* N/A, indicating that this item does not apply (only an option for items in certain checks)

If any item within a check results in No, be aware that your cloud service offering may not be ready to undergo an assessment or have its package submitted to FedRAMP. Strongly consider addressing the deficiencies before continuing. 

The appropriate personnel to perform the checks for a cloud service offering will vary by organization. All checks require a solid understanding of cybersecurity and the cloud service offering itself. 

Some parts of checks are strictly editorial in nature – for example, ensuring that a file is present, a diagram is legible, or a plan contains all the sections specified by a template. These parts are labeled as \[Editorial\]. 

# **Check 1: Scope**

The cloud service provider must perform an analysis of the Integrated Inventory Workbook (IIW), vulnerability scans, authorization boundary diagram (ABD), and the associated SSP sections to answer the following questions.   
NOTE: For Rev. 5, see SSP Sections 8.1 and 9.1 and Appendix Q. For Rev. 4, see SSP Sections 9.2, 9.4, and 10.1.

| Are all asset types (operating systems, web servers, container images, etc.) that are listed in SSP System Diagram and System Description reflected in the IIW? | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Are raw vulnerability scan files provided in machine-readable format and with the following data fields? IP Address FQDN/hostname Ports, Protocols, Services Cryptographic modules Unique detection identifier (tool-specific) CVE identifier Relevant CVSS score CVSS temporal and environmental vectors Original detection date | Yes No |
| Are all components listed in the IIW targeted in the scans, and vice versa? | Yes No |
| Are all ports (non-ephemeral/ephemeral), protocols, and services listed in the SSP Ports & Protocols Table in alignment with open ports found in the scans? | Yes No |
| For Rev. 5, do IIW components match all listed cryptographic modules in SSP Appendix Q, and vice versa? | Yes No N/A |

 

# **Check 2: Visibility**

The cloud service provider must perform an analysis of the IIW, vulnerability scans, and POA\&M deliverables to answer the following questions:

| Are the scans performed with elevated privileges (\<10% authentication failure rate)? | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Are Network, OS, DB, Web, Container, and SAST/SCA scans performed as applicable on all IIW components? | Yes No |

# **Check 3: Governance** 

The cloud service provider must perform an analysis of the SSP (table where the System Owner, Model, and ISSO are identified) to answer the following questions.  
NOTE: FedRAMP does not review packages for private clouds, grant a FedRAMP Authorized designation, or list private clouds on the FedRAMP Marketplace because the concept of “reuse” does not apply.

| Is the deployment model for the service offering applicable to the agency's use and potential government data involved (public vs. government-only community)?  | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| If applicable, does the SSP annotate why "hybrid" was selected, and does this actually apply to the service offering based on the architecture? | Yes No N/A |
| Is the deployment model listed in the SSP the same as the cloud service offering's FedRAMP Marketplace listing?  | Yes No |
| If the cloud service offering is listed as non-public, do the SSP and Access Control Policy document how customer restrictions are enforced via the sales pipeline? | Yes No N/A |
| Does the System Owner have the organizational authority to address risk for *all* components, processes, and people included in the scope of system policies (budget, resources, charter, etc.)?  | Yes No |

# **Check 4: SSP Front Matter and Attachments/Appendices**

The cloud service provider must perform the following checks around the SSP front matter and attachments/appendices.

## **Check 4A: ISCP and CP test report** 

| Does the package include an Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP)? \[Rev. 5 \-  SSP Appendix G; Rev. 4 \- SSP Attachment 6\] \[Editorial\] | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Does the ISCP include a corresponding CP test report? \[Rev. 5 \- ISCP Appendix F; Rev. 4 \- ISCP Appendix G\]  It may be included in the associated template, or it may be provided as a separate attachment. \[Editorial\] | Yes No |
| Does the ISCP use the FedRAMP ISCP Template associated with [Revision 4](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/rev4/REV_4_SSP-A06-FedRAMP-ISCP-Template.docx) or [Revision 5](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SSP-Appendix-G-Information-System-Contingency-Plan-\(ISCP\)-Template.docx) (as appropriate)? Are all portions of the template present? (Information may be added to the template.) Have all sections of the template been completed? \[Editorial\] | Yes No |
| Is the CP test report from within the last 12 months? \[Editorial\] | Yes No |
| Does the CP test report include the parts (date, lessons learned, etc.) from the FedRAMP ISCP Template? Does the test indicate whether the cloud service provider is able to meet its RTO and RPO objectives? | Yes No |

## **Check 4B: Rationale for N/A controls** 

Review the CIS Worksheet tab in the CIS/CRM workbook to quickly identify the controls that are marked N/A. \[Rev. 5 \- SSP Appendix J; Rev. 4 \- SSP Attachment 9\] If there are none, this check does not apply, so skip to the next check (check 4C).  
Cloud service providers often misidentify controls as N/A when the capability exists but is not authorized for use per system policies. For example, many cloud service providers consider AC-2(2) to be N/A because temporary/emergency accounts are not used in the environment. FedRAMP considers this control to be applicable. In the AC-2(2) implementation statement, the cloud service provider should reference the policy that prohibits the creation of temporary/emergency accounts and describe any technical controls in place to prevent the creation of and/or audit unauthorized accounts.

| For each control that is marked N/A, is a rationale provided in the corresponding control implementation statement in the SSP as to why the control is not needed? \[Rev. 5 \- SSP Appendix A; Rev. 4 \- SSP Section 13\]  | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Are controls marked N/A only if they are not technically or functionally applicable to the system? | Yes No |

## **Check 4C: Consistency between CRM and SSP** 

| Do the control originations specified in the SSP Control Summary Information table match the CIS/CRM workbook entries? \[Rev. 5 \- SSP Appendix J; Rev. 4 \- SSP Attachment 9\] | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Are customer responsibilities clearly delineated in the SSP control implementation statement from the cloud service provider’s responsibilities? | Yes No |
| Do controls address what the customer must do to fulfill their responsibilities for the control?  | Yes No |
| For controls that indicate a customer responsibility, is there a corresponding entry in the CRM within the CIS/CRM workbook that addresses every distinct use case (e.g., unique services or features) where customer responsibilities apply? | Yes No |
| For controls inherited from other cloud service offering vendors, does the CRM match the vendors’ CRM lists of inheritable controls? | Yes No N/A |

## **Check 4D: Diagram readability and consistency** 

The SSP’s authorization boundary diagram (ABD), network diagram, and data flow diagram (DFD) are either included within the SSP \[Rev. 5 \- Section 8.1; Rev. 4 \- Sections 9.2, 9.4, and 10.1\] or are provided as separate attachments. Some cloud service providers choose to combine the ABD, network diagram, and DFDs into a single holistic diagram. This is acceptable.

| For all these diagram(s), is the resolution fully legible, including all characters being clearly distinguishable? \[Editorial\] | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| If separate files are provided for diagrams, are all of the following true for each of those files?  The file opens properly. \[Editorial\] The specific filename is referenced in the associated SSP section with versioning information. \[Editorial\] Each diagram within the separate file(s) has the same figure number corresponding with the figure number used in the SSP. All text within the diagrams is searchable. \[Editorial\] | Yes No N/A |

## **Check 4E: ABD and narrative consistency** 

This involves comparing the ABD to the narrative sections and tables within the SSP to identify any inconsistencies in documenting the services used by the cloud service offering.

Note: For Rev. 5, see SSP Sections 8.1 and 8.2, and Tables 6.1 and 7.1. For Rev. 4, see Section 9.2, Tables 8-3 and 11-1, and Control CA-3 in Table 13-3.

| Are all flows to/from external services clearly depicted on the ABD? | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Are all services depicted on the ABD also explained in the narrative description? Are all services explained in the narrative description also depicted on the ABD? | Yes No |
| Is each external service identified either as FedRAMP Authorized or as lacking FedRAMP authorization? | Yes No |
| For each service identified as FedRAMP Authorized, does its name match the FedRAMP Marketplace naming convention? | Yes No N/A |
| For each transport service, is its destination depicted? Does supporting text describe the purpose of data delivered to its destination? | Yes No |

## **Check 4F: External services with federal data/metadata** 

| For each interconnected external service that stores/processes federal government data and/or metadata, is one of the following true? The external service is FedRAMP-authorized or FISMA-authorized at the same or higher impact level as the cloud service offering, based on the impact level (high, moderate, low) of federal government data and/or metadata that is stored/processed in the external service. The external service is either lacking a FedRAMP or FISMA authorization altogether OR is not authorized at the same or higher impact level, but there is a corresponding POA\&M that describes the cloud service provider's plans to remediate the risk by moving impacted functionality to a FedRAMP or FISMA authorized service at the same or higher impact level that describes mitigating factors that may reduce the risk.  | Yes No N/A |
| :---- | :---- |

## **Check 4G: Architecture documentation content review** 

| Are all data flows crossing the boundary depicted in the ABD and include the following? All customer and cloud service offering administrator access The flow of software releases from update services to production components (e.g., application updates or patches) Flows to the customer's site (e.g., access to agency’s identity management service) Component-to-component flows In general, depicting flows to groups such as VPCs is insufficient. cloud service providers may make reasonable exceptions, such as depicting a single flow from a scanner going to a text box that describes the components accessed by the scanner (rather than a separate flow to each scanned component). | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| At a minimum, does the ABD depict access flows for the following? Customer users Customer administrators cloud service offering administrator to cloud service offering cloud service offering administrator to IaaS/PaaS console Non-human account access flows | Yes No |
| Does access flow have a high-level depiction of MFA in the ABD? | Yes No |
| Does a corresponding narrative description provide details about the ABD’s access flows? | Yes No |
| Do the ABD and narrative address the following? Authentication consistent with IA-5 (see Check 4L in RIC Part 1 and Check 5B in RIC Part 2). Authentication tokens must be generated by an identity provider (IdP) where: The IdP is inside an authorized boundary, OR The IdP authorization is at the same, or higher, impact level. Authentication tokens must be encrypted when passed through a browser. | Yes No |
| Does the ABD depict the alternate processing and storage site? Is there a corresponding narrative description? Are differences between alternate site configuration and primary site configuration depicted and described? | Yes No |
| In the network diagram, are all of the following true? Is the authoritative DNS server for external access to the cloud service offering (SC-20) depicted? Is the recursive DNS server for external access from the cloud service offering's boundary (SC-21) depicted? Is the recursive server inside a FedRAMP Authorized boundary? Are the connections from cloud service offering components to the recursive server trusted?  Are subnets clearly depicted and consistent with SSP narratives, including SC-7 control description? Do subnets adhere to structures described in the [FedRAMP Subnets White Paper](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_subnets_white_paper.pdf), including publicly accessible components in separate subnets and operational and management components in separate subnets? | Yes No |

## **Check 4H: Data flow documentation review** 

For the following checks, see SSP sections 8.1 and 8.2 (for Rev. 5\) and 10.1 (for Rev. 4).

| Are the DFD(s) consistent with their own narrative descriptions in the SSP and with relevant control descriptions (e.g., SC-8(1), SC-13, SC-28)? | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| If multiple DFDs are used: Does each child diagram include a descriptive name that specifies what the particular diagram is depicting in relation to the parent diagram? Does the parent diagram indicate where a child diagram fits into the overall cloud service offering using the same descriptive name of the child diagram? | Yes No N/A |
| On the DFD(s), is the encryption status of all data in transit (data flows) and data at rest (data stores) clearly depicted as one of the following? Encrypted with FIPS-validated modules Encrypted without FIPS-validated modules Unencrypted data flows and stores | Yes No |
| On the DFD(s), do the flows to data stores include the following? All encryption in the management VPC Flows from management tools required for their work (log collection, scanning, etc.) Flows and stores associated with disk/block storage attached to compute components Flows and stores inside container environments | Yes No |
| Are flows for backup and alternate processing sites shown on the DFD(s)? | Yes No |
| Are network components where encryption can terminate (e.g., load balancers and firewalls) included on the DFD(s)? | Yes No |

## **Check 4I: CM-6 control narrative** 

Review the control narrative for CM-6. \[Rev. 5 \- SSP appendix A; Rev. 4 \- SSP section 13\]

| Does it explicitly specify the IT products (e.g., database, operating system, web server) where configuration settings have been applied? For example, Solaris 11 SPARC STIG – Ver. 2, Rel 9\.

| Does MFA involve a separate device than the system being accessed? For example, using an authenticator app on a mobile device. | Yes No |
| Are the make and model (e.g., OTP, hardware token) of the MFA specified, as well as the FIPS-validated certificate number (if applicable)?  If the MFA is included in a FedRAMP Authorized service, is the associated leveraged service referenced? (Doing so is sufficient.) If an NSA-approved product is used, is the source document listed for obtaining information related to the NSA approval? | Yes No |
| Are all modes of MFA access consistent with those depicted in the ABD? | Yes No |
| Does each have a tool (by vendor) and protocol level (e.g., PIV, OTP, Push) depiction of MFA? | Yes No |
| Is PIV/CAC support indicated for all federal government personnel access? | Yes No |

# RFC-0003 - Review Initiation Check (RIC) Part 2: Post-Assessment

# **OVERVIEW** 

Optional FedRAMP Review Initiation Checks (RIC) help cloud service providers, independent assessors, and federal agency partners understand how FedRAMP evaluates and verifies the completeness, consistency, accuracy, and clarity of an authorization package. Following these checks properly will enable expedited review by FedRAMP and increase the likelihood of a smooth FedRAMP authorization process.

* **RIC Part 1** may be used by the cloud service provider to self-assess after the preparation of the System Security Plan but prior to the independent security assessment of the cloud service offering. 

* **RIC Part 2** may be used by the cloud service provider to self-assess after the completion of the independent security assessment of the cloud service offering and after the preparation of the Security Assessment Plan and Security Assessment Report.

This document contains the RIC Part 2\.

# **RIC Part 2**

The RIC Part 2 checks are to be performed after the initial assessment has been completed and the Security Assessment Plan, Security Assessment Report, and corresponding artifacts have been produced. Each item within each check will generate one of the following results:

* Yes, indicating that this item is fully met  
* No, indicating that this item is applicable but is not fully met  
* N/A, indicating that this item does not apply (only an option for items in certain checks)

If any item within a check results in No, be aware that your cloud service offering may not be ready to have its package submitted to FedRAMP. Strongly consider addressing the deficiencies before continuing. 

The appropriate personnel to perform the checks for a cloud service offering will vary by organization. All checks require a solid understanding of cybersecurity and the cloud service offering itself.

Some parts of checks are strictly editorial in nature – for example, ensuring that a file is present, a diagram is legible, or a plan contains all the sections specified by a template. These parts are labeled as \[Editorial\]. 

# **Check 5: SAR Breadth and Depth** 

The following checks are to be performed primarily on the SAR, with other documents mentioned specifically when needed. 

## **Check 5A: Validation of N/A controls** 

| If any controls are listed as N/A in the SSP, have they all been validated by the IA as being N/A? | Yes No N/A |
| :---- | :---- |

## **Check 5B: Validation of O\&E and scan results for specific controls** 

Consult the Observations and Evidence (O\&E) information for the specified assessment objectives and, where applicable, artifacts and vulnerability/compliance scan results to answer the following questions:

| Regarding CM-6.a and CM-6.b: Did the IA specify the IT products that were validated to have configuration settings applied? Do the vulnerability/compliance scans validate that hardening is actually occurring on all production components? | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Regarding CP-9: Do the O\&Es describe how the IA validated that all parts of the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended (versus simply echoing the control requirement)? | Yes No |
| Regarding IA-2(6) \[Rev. 5\] or IA-2(11) \[Rev. 4\]:  Do the O\&Es describe how the IA validated that all parts of the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended (versus simply echoing the control requirement)? If the IA issued a SAR finding because the MFA is not FIPS-validated or NSA-approved, is the remediation plan in the POA\&M reasonable? For example, migrating from an MFA that is not FIPS-validated to a MFA that is FIPS-validated should not take a year. | Yes No |
| Regarding IA-5, if the cloud service offering provides identity management as a part of the service offering, does the O\&E describe all of the following? How authentication is implemented for cloud service offering access How AAL authentication is supported for customer deployment. In particular: The cloud service offering’s capability to meet the requirements in item 1 of check 4L for each impact level. The customer responsibilities for compliant configuration at each impact level. How IAL and FAL are supported for customer deployment (as appropriate) At least one compliant configuration exists for the capabilities described for items 5b and 5c of check 4L | Yes No N/A |
| Regarding IA-8(1): Do the O\&Es describe how the IA validated that the control is implemented correctly and operating as intended (versus simply echoing the control requirement)? *Validating that there is a PIV option on the application front-end is not sufficient.* | Yes No |
| Regarding RA-5 and RA-5(5): Do the vulnerability scans validate the completeness and scope of the subnet range targets against the Inventory and SSP Ports, Protocols and Services table? | Yes No |
| Regarding SC-7: Do the O\&Es describe how the IA validated that the control is implemented correctly and operating as intended (versus simply repeating the control requirement)? | Yes No |
| Regarding SC-13: Do the O\&Es describe how the IA validated that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended (versus simply repeating the control requirement)?  Do the O\&Es discuss each flow (source to destination) that was reviewed and specify the associated FIPS-validated or NSA-approved cryptographic module (CM) (and its certificate number) that is encrypting that flow? For information traversing certain components (e.g., firewalls) that is being decrypted, do the O\&Es validate that the same information that is de-encrypted is also re-encrypted by the same component and that FIPS-validated or NSA-approved CMs are in use? Do the O\&Es discuss each data store that was reviewed and the associated FIPS-validated or NSA-approved CM that is encrypting that store? Do the vulnerability scans confirm that there are no findings around the use of insecure or non-FIPS approved cryptographic algorithms? | Yes No |
| If the assessment result for any of the above assessment objectives is "Other than Satisfied," are all control failures documented as follows? Rev. 4: If the control failure was corrected during testing, it was captured in SAR Section 5.1 (Risks Corrected During Testing). Rev. 4: If the control failure was not corrected during testing, it was captured in the SAR RET with a corresponding item in the POA\&M. Rev. 5: If the control failure was corrected during testing, it was captured in the SAR RET on the “Risks Corrected During Testing” tab. Rev. 5: If the control failure was not corrected during testing, it was captured in the SAR RET on the “Risk Exposure Table (RET)” tab, with a corresponding item in the POA\&M. | Yes No N/A |

## **Check 5C: SAR Executive Summary text** 

NOTE: This check only applies to the FedRAMP Rev. 5 SAR Template.

| Does the first paragraph of SAR Section 2 (Executive Summary) read as follows: “*This is an initial assessment SAR as required by FedRAMP. This SAR aggregates the results of the required FedRAMP security assessment of the \<CSO Name\> environment as recorded in the \<CSO Name\> SSP*”? \[Editorial\] | Yes No N/A |
| :---- | :---- |

## **Check 5D: Clear IA recommendation** 

NOTE: FedRAMP will not accept a package that includes a non-recommendation from the IA. If the IA has issued a non-recommendation, the cloud service provider must remediate the risks that led to the non-recommendation AND the IA must validate the remediations in order to get to a favorable recommendation before the package is submitted to FedRAMP for review.

| For Rev. 5, review SAR Section 2 (Executive Summary). Regarding the recommendation: Does it use one of the "templated" statements provided in the “Executive Summary” section of the SAR?  \[Editorial\] Is it NOT contingent on other factors? Does it NOT include caveats or qualifying/conditional statements? | Yes No N/A |
| :---- | :---- |
| For Rev. 4, review SAR Section 7 (Authorization Recommendation). Regarding the recommendation: Does it use the "templated" language in the SAR?  \[Editorial\] Is it NOT contingent on other factors? Does it NOT include caveats or qualifying/conditional statements? | Yes No N/A |

### 

## **Check 5E: Penetration test report** 

NOTE: The penetration test report document may be uploaded separately to the secure repository if not embedded within the SAR. If embedded, it is in Appendix F for Rev. 5 and Appendix J for Rev. 4\.

| Does the penetration test report include testing of all of the attack vectors specified in the [*FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance*](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Penetration_Test_Guidance.pdf)? | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| If an IA determined that a certain attack vector is not applicable, does the penetration test report clearly state the rationale for its exclusion from testing? For example, mobile application testing was not performed because there is no mobile application within the authorization boundary. | Yes No N/A |

## **Check 5F: SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET)** }

| Is the RET template unaltered? \[Editorial\] | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Does the RET account for all scan findings? | Yes No |

## **Check 5G: SAR consistency cross-checks** 

### Instructions for Rev. 5 

| Do the number of findings and risk categories documented in SAR Section 2-2 (Summary of Risks That Remained Open at the Conclusion of this Assessment) match the number of findings and risk ratings documented in the RET? Filter on the specific columns in a variety of combinations in the RET to determine original and adjusted risk ratings, operational requirements (OR), and vendor dependencies (VD). For example:  In the RET, filter column L (“Adjusted Risk Rating”) to determine the number of findings for each risk-adjusted category (L, M, H). In the RET, filter column N (“Operational Requirements”) to determine the number of ORs findings by each original and risk-adjusted category (L, M, H). | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Are the findings captured consistently within SAR Appendix B? The values in the “System” tab and “CrtlSummary” tab are auto populated as each individual control family tab is completed. Perform the following spot checks to verify the formulas are calculating correctly: On the “CrtlSummary” tab, filter column D (“Assessment Result”) by “Other than Satisfied”. The result should match the number in cell B11 of the “System” tab. Cross-check a sampling of test results between the “System” tab, “CrtlSummary” tab, and individual control family tabs. For example, in the “AC” tab, filter column N (“Risk Exposure Level”) by Low, Moderate, or High. The result for each risk exposure level should match the AC Summary Risk Exposure Levels of the “System” tab. | Yes No |
| Are findings captured consistently between the SAR Appendix B and the RET? Validate this by performing the following: In the “CrtlSummary” tab, filter column D (“Assessment Result”) by “Other than Satisfied”. In the RET, validate that the “Other Than Satisfied” items noted in the SRTM are in only one of the following tabs: In the “Risk Exposure Table (RET)” tab (if still an open risk), or In the “Risks Corrected During Testing” tab (if the risk was addressed and validated by the IA as corrected before the SAR was completed). Verify consistency with other key concerns noted in the “CrtlSummary” tab such as Risk Exposure Level and SSP Differential. If SSP Differentials are indicated ("1" in column F of the “CrtlSummary” tab), there should be a corresponding PL-2 finding(s) in the RET, if not listed in the “Risks Corrected During Testing” tab. | Yes No |
| Are findings documented in the penetration test report included in the RET? Penetration testing results are typically represented in the Weakness Detector Source as “Penetration Test” or “Manual Testing”. | Yes No |

### Instructions for Rev. 4 

| Do the number of findings and risk ratings documented in SAR Section 7 (Authorization Recommendation) match the number of findings and risk ratings documented in both Table F-1 (Assessment Findings) and the RET? In the RET, filter column N (Risk Exposure after Mitigating Controls / Factors) to determine the number of findings for each impact level (L, M, H). | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Is the source of discovery (Assessment Test Cases, OS scans, etc.) in Table F-1 consistent with column C (Source of Discovery) in the RET? In the RET, filter column C to determine the number of findings for each source (Assessment Test Cases, OS scans, etc.). | Yes No |
| Is the RET consistent with Tables 5-2 and 5-3 in the SAR? Compare Table 5-2 in the SAR to columns I through N in the RET for consistency. Compare Table 5-3 in the SAR to column O for consistency. NOTE: The RET does not include a column for "Operational Requirements". IAs use column O (“Recommendation”) to document validated ORs. | Yes No |
| Are the findings captured consistently within SAR Appendix B? The values in the “System” tab and “CtrlSummary” tab are auto populated as each individual control family tab is completed. Perform the following spot checks to verify the formulas are calculating correctly: In the “CrtlSummary” tab, filter column D (“Assessment Result”) by “Other than Satisfied”. The result should match the number in cell B11 in the “System” tab. Cross-check a sampling of test results between the “System” tab, “CrtlSummary” tab, and individual control family tabs. For example, on the “AC” tab, filter column N (“Risk Exposure Level”) by Low, Moderate, or High. The result for each risk exposure level should match the Access Control \- Summary Risk Exposure Levels in the “System” tab.  | Yes No |
| Are findings captured consistently between the SAR Appendix B and the RET?  In the “CrtlSummary” tab, filter column E (“Assessment Result”) by “Other than Satisfied”. Each control finding must be documented in one of two places: In the SAR RET (if still an open risk), or In the SAR Table 5-1 (if the risk was addressed and validated by the IA as corrected before the SAR was completed). Verify consistency with other key concerns noted in the “CrtlSummary” tab such as Risk Exposure Level and SSP Implementation Statement Differential. If SSP Differentials are indicated ("Yes" in column G of the “CrtlSummary” tab), there should be a corresponding PL-2 finding(s) in the RET (if not listed in the SAR Table 5-1). | Yes No |
| Are the findings documented in the penetration test report included in the RET? | Yes No |

## **Check 5H: SAR and POA\&M consistency cross-checks** 

| Does the POA\&M identifier track with the RET identifier for traceability? Rev. 4: Use the RET identifier as the POA\&M identifier or alternatively add the corresponding RET identifier to column Z (“Comments”) in the POA\&M. Rev. 5: IAs are instructed to use the cloud service provider-established POA\&M identifier schema to assign a unique identifier to each RET item. | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| For each finding documented in the RET, is there at least one corresponding finding in the POA\&M’s “Open” items tab? | Yes No N/A |
| For risks corrected during testing, is there a corresponding finding in the POA\&M’s “Closed” items tab? This must include all findings identified during initial testing and then validated as closed (i.e., "corrected") by an IA. Rev. 4: Compare SAR Table 5-1 to the POA\&M’s “Closed” items tab. Rev. 5: Compare the RET’s “Risks Corrected During Testing” tab to the POA\&M’s “Closed” items tab. | Yes No N/A |
| Do POA\&Ms associated with vulnerability findings map to the relevant IIW/vulnerability scan target components where the vulnerability was found? | Yes No |

## **Check 5I: Rationales for FPs, RAs, and ORs** 

Review the IA-provided rationales for validated false positives (FPs), risk adjustments (RAs), and operational requirements (ORs). For Rev. 5, see SAR Appendix A. For Rev. 4, see SAR Tables 5-2 and 5-3.

| Does each RA include a description of the rationale for it and mitigating factors or compensating controls in place that reduce likelihood and/or impact of exploitation?  Adjustments from a High-risk rating to a Low-risk rating will be heavily scrutinized by FedRAMP and (in most cases) are NOT acceptable.  | Yes No N/A |
| :---- | :---- |
| An OR is a finding that cannot be remediated, often because the system will not function as intended or because a vendor explicitly indicated it does not intend to offer a fix to their product. Does each OR have a sufficient description of the rationale for it?  FedRAMP will not approve an OR for a High vulnerability; however, cloud service providers may mitigate the risk to enable it to be downgraded. | Yes No N/A |
| Did the IA objectively validate with supporting evidence that claimed FPs were accurate? Was a well-established source (e.g., CISA VEX, vendor-supplied information) leveraged? | Yes No N/A |

## **Check 5J: Monthly ConMon deliverables** 

Review the monthly POA\&M deliverable, monthly IIW deliverable, and monthly scan deliverables (OS/Network, Web, DB, and container) if the cloud service provider is responsible for vulnerability scans to answer the following questions:  
NOTE: This check is only relevant if one or more months have passed since the independent assessment concluded.

| Is the cloud service provider uploading ConMon deliverables on a monthly basis? This includes raw scan files and scan reports, an up-to-date inventory, and up-to-date POA\&M. | Yes No |
| :---- | :---- |
| Is the date of the POA\&M accurate? The date is reflected in cell D3 of the POA\&M’s “Open” items tab. | Yes No |
| Are POA\&M items documented in accordance with the [*FedRAMP POA\&M Template Completion Guide*](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_POAM_Template_Completion_Guide.pdf)? | Yes No |
| Is the cloud service provider tracking each unique vulnerability scan finding as an individual POA\&M item? POA\&M findings must be based on the scanning tool’s unique vulnerability reference identifier. The cloud service provider may break a unique vulnerability into multiple POA\&M items to track the vulnerability at a more granular level (e.g., a vulnerability that applies to different asset types that will be remediated in different ways); however, a cloud service provider must not group multiple unique vulnerabilities into a single POA\&M item. | Yes No N/A |
| Are VDs and DRs correctly captured in the POA\&M? Are vendor dependencies being reviewed each month? Is there evidence that the vendor has announced concrete plans to issue a patch? The [*FedRAMP CSP Authorization Playbook*](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Authorization_Playbook.pdf) (Section 5.1 \- General POA\&M Guidance) describes how to correctly capture VDs and DRs in the POA\&M. | Yes No N/A |
| Has the cloud service provider maintained the POA\&M’s “Scheduled Completion Date” in the template? The scheduled completion date is automatically populated based on the POA\&M’s “Original Detection Date” and risk rating. Cloud service providers must not modify the “Scheduled Completion Date” column. Any date changes should be reflected in the "Planned Milestones" or "Milestone Changes" column. | Yes No |
| Does the POA\&M indicate that the cloud service provider is consistently remediating risks for the cloud service offering within the FedRAMP remediation timeframes? | Yes No |
| Do the scans cover the full breadth of the system inventory, including ports and protocols listed in the SSP and configuration validations? | Yes No |
| Are the scans being performed with privileged access? Is the percentage of authentication failures under 10%? | Yes No |
| Do the scans provide all necessary data fields? | Yes No |
| Does the inventory and scans show consistency? For example, no added/removed components without significant change requests month over a month?  Investigate ports in the ephemeral ranges that are consistently open across multiple scans. | Yes No |
| Do the configuration baselines drift from the initial SAR scans (or current baseline)? | Yes No |
| Are all findings in the scan that reflect inadequate control implementation documented as manual POA\&M findings in addition to the vulnerability finding (unsupported components are an SA-22 finding, insecure cryptographic algorithms are an SC-13 finding, etc.)? | Yes No N/A |
