| [0001](0001) | [A New Commment Process for FedRAMP](0001) | Extended open discussion period for feedback on the pilot FedRAMP RFC process using GitHub. | 2024-12-18 | 2025-01-31 |

## Background

44 U.S. Code ยง 3609 (a)(6) requires FedRAMP to _"establish and maintain a public
comment process for proposed guidance and other FedRAMP directives that may have
a direct impact on cloud service providers and agencies before the issuance of
such guidance or other FedRAMP directives."_

In the beginning of FY25, FedRAMP is piloting a Request for Comments (RFC)
process using GitHub, with individual RFCs posted as separate repositories with
Discussion features enabled. Stakeholders will be able to discuss and interact
with comments and propose changes, and FedRAMP will be able to review
continuously and request clarification as needed. Traditional comment submission
via email will still be accepted.
