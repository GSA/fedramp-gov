## Summary

FedRAMP worked with the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA)
to identify how to best revise FedRAMP’s 3PAO policy based on stakeholder
feedback. This collaboration resulted in proposed revisions to six requirements
including participation in the Baltimore cyber range, requirements for different
roles, and an appendix for training focus areas.

## Motivation

As a part of FedRAMP’s ongoing commitment to improvement and stakeholder
engagement, a 3PAO strategy session was held in FY24 to collaborate on solutions
for addressing current challenges faced by both FedRAMP and FedRAMP-recognized
3PAOs. Specifically, two main challenge areas were discussed:

1. FedRAMP highlighted the persistence of assessment deliverables that did not
   meet FedRAMP performance standards around documentation quality and testing
   accuracy/completeness, which resulted in multiple security package
   resubmissions.

2. The 3PAO participants expressed their concerns regarding the high costs of
   training junior staff, which was inhibiting team growth.

At the conclusion of the session, a consensus was made that the best approach to
address these challenge areas was to revise FedRAMP’s 3PAO requirements around
training and certifications to minimize 3PAO personnel training costs while also
ensuring assessors were sufficiently trained to produce high quality products to
the federal government.

## Explanation

The full explanation for the proposed changes is approximately nine pages and
can be viewed directly as follows:

## Discussion Requested

We are asking for feedback to ensure the proposed personnel training and
certification requirement updates will not impose overly burdensome costs on
3PAOs and to gain alignment on the benefit of updating personnel training and
certification requirements to enhance personnel skills needed to perform
successful FedRAMP assessments.

# RFC-0002 - Proposed Revisions to FedRAMP 3PAO Requirements

FedRAMP Recognized 3PAOs –

As a part of FedRAMP’s ongoing commitment to improvement and stakeholder
engagement, a 3PAO strategy session was held in FY24 to collaborate on solutions
for addressing current challenges faced by both FedRAMP and FedRAMP recognized
3PAOs. Specifically, two main challenge areas were discussed:

1. FedRAMP highlighted the persistence of assessment deliverables that did not
   meet FedRAMP performance standards around documentation quality and testing
   accuracy/completeness, which resulted in multiple security package
   resubmissions.

2. The 3PAO participants expressed their concerns regarding the high costs of
   training junior staff, which was inhibiting team growth.

At the conclusion of the session, a consensus was made that the best approach to
address these challenge areas was to revise FedRAMP’s 3PAO requirements around
training and certifications to minimize 3PAO personnel training costs while also
ensuring assessors were sufficiently trained to produce high quality products to
the federal government.

As a next step, FedRAMP worked with the American Association for Laboratory
Accreditation (A2LA) to identify how to best revise FedRAMP’s 3PAO policy
([A2LA R311 – Specific Requirements: Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://a2la.qualtraxcloud.com/ShowDocument.aspx?ID=5621)),
which is published, maintained, and enforced by A2LA. This collaboration
resulted in the following general and personnel proposed requirement revisions
(italicized) organized by the section they appear in the current version of the
A2LA R311:

## General Requirements

### Requirement 4.5:

Participation in the Baltimore Cyber Range (BCR) technical participation
activity was expanded to include an individual testing exercise for penetration
testers.

_BCR Cyber Penetration Tester Technical Proficiency Activity_

_The BCR Cyber Penetration Tester Technical Proficiency Activity is an
individual certification obtained by the penetration tester which consists of a
multiple-choice written evaluation and a real-time assessment of a multi-server
network environment. Both the written and network evaluation are conducted
remotely with the penetration tester utilizing a third party assessment
organization (3PAO) workstation for evaluation access._

_The written evaluation provides the practitioners an opportunity to demonstrate
basic penetration knowledge while the assessment exercise evaluates the
practitioner’s ability to perform a penetration test and identify issues of a
compromised network. To assure fairness, practitioners are provided a common
suite of industry standard tools. Note, the penetration tester must have
sufficient knowledge of Kali Linux and Metasploit tools to perform the technical
testing activities. Network external and internal Kali Linux/Metasploit servers
are provided for practitioner use. The target system includes Windows
workstations, Linux servers, Windows servers, and a pfSense router. The
practitioner must map system component implementation and configuration issues
to NIST SP 800-53A controls and/or control enhancements identified for each
individual evaluation activity. Actual exam content varies per individual
tester._

_Five NIST SP 800-53A controls/control enhancements are presented for
evaluation. The activity is intended to demonstrate a practitioner’s ability to
test and accurately identify evidence/artifacts required to document
non-compliant security controls in the multi-server network environment. The
provided Penetration Evaluation Test Report (PETR) template is the testing
activity report document._

_Participation Details_

_The evaluations are completed remotely. Zoom, a compatible browser, high-speed
internet access, access to the assessors’ email account, and a workstation
camera (to support Zoom) are the key system evaluation requirements. Access to
the evaluation network is provided via browser. Required credentials are
provided at the start of the evaluation._

**Impact and Rationale:** Currently, only senior and junior assessors are
required to demonstrate their FedRAMP assessment competencies by taking and
passing the BCR technical proficiency exercise. Penetration testers will now
also be expected to take and pass a technical exercise focused on how to perform
a penetration test based on FedRAMP standards. This will enable FedRAMP and
3PAOs to ensure penetration testers have the minimum qualifications needed to
successfully perform a FedRAMP-specific penetration test.

## Personnel Requirements

### Requirement 6.1.1 F.2:

The senior assessor role’s experience and certification levels were revised for
closer alignment with the DoD 8140 Cyber Workforce Qualification Program
certification requirements for training, certifying, and managing a
cybersecurity workforce.

> _3PAOs must employ at least one_ “senior assessor” _for each FedRAMP
> assessment, regardless of the type of assessment. This individual_ is
> accountable for the overall quality of deliverables and signs off on
> assessment _activities performed by the rest of the team._ A senior assessor
> must have at least five years of auditing and/or assessment experience _and
> maintain at least two certifications, where at least one certification must be
> from the Tier 1 Certifications list (below) and an additional certification
> from either of the associated certification tiers (i.e., Tier 1 or Tier 2)
> annotated below._
>
> A senior assessor must have at least five years of auditing and/or assessment
> experience _and maintain at least two certifications, where at least one
> certification must be from the Tier 1 Certifications list (below) and an
> additional certification from either of the associated certification tiers
> (i.e., Tier 1 or Tier 2) annotated below:_
>
> - **Tier 1 Certifications**
>
>   - _Certified Information Systems Security Professional or Associate (CISSP
>     or Associate)_
>   - _CISSP-Information Systems Security Architecture Professional
>     (CISSP-ISSAP)_
>   - _CISSP-Information Systems Security Engineering Professional
>     (CISSP-ISSEP)_
>   - _CISSP-Information Systems Security Management Professional (CISSP-ISSMP)_
>   - _Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)_
>   - _CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+)_
>   - Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)
>   - Certified Information Security Manager (CISM)
>   - _GIAC Certified Enterprise Defender (GCED)_
>   - _GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)_
>   - _GIAC Security Leadership (GSLC)_
>   - _CyberSec First Responder (CFR)_
>   - _Certified Chief Information Security Officer (CCISO)_
>
> - **Tier 2 Certifications**
>   - _Governance, Risk, and Compliance Certification (CGRC)_
>   - _AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, Professional, or Security
>     Specialty_
>   - _Azure Security Engineer Associate_
>   - _Google Professional Cloud Architect_
>   - _Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect_
>   - _GIAC Systems and Network Auditor (GSNA)_
>   - _GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC)_
>   - _CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)_
>   - _CompTIA Cloud+ (Cloud+)_
>   - _CompTIA Security+ (Security+)_
>   - _Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK)_
>   - _Global Industrial Cyber Security Professional (GICSP)_

**Impact and Rationale**: 3PAOs indicated that it was critical for their
organizations to align FedRAMP personnel certification requirements with other
major government compliance programs to allow maximum flexibility for how they
staff assessments.

### Requirement 6.1.1 F.3:

The penetration tester role’s experience and certification levels were revised
for closer alignment with the DoD 8140 Cyber Workforce Qualification Program
certification requirements for training, certifying, and managing a
cybersecurity workforce.

> 3PAOs must have a personnel type that is a “penetration tester”, _for each
> FedRAMP assessment, that_ has the technical competence to perform a
> _penetration test as part of the assessment scope. This individual must have_
> the technical competence to be able to _lead the_ penetration test, in
> accordance with FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance and requirements. This
> person must _also_ be proficient in _planning, executing, and reporting on all
> facets of the penetration test._ A 3PAO penetration tester must have two years
> of penetration testing experience and at least one industry certification
> related to enhancing the knowledge and skills needed to perform penetration
> testing activities from the following list:
>
> - Cisco Certified Network Professional Security (CCNP Security)
> - CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+) Continuing Education (CE)
> - Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
> - Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP)
> - CISSP-Information Systems Security Engineering Professional (CISSP-ISSEP)
> - SANS GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN)
> - GIAC Certified Enterprise Defender (GCED)
> - Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
> - Cisco Certified Network Associate-Cyber-Ops (CCNA Cyber Ops)
> - Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator (CHFI)
> - GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst (GCFA)
> - CompTIA PenTest+
> - _OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP)_
> - _OffSec Web Expert (OSWE)_
> - _OffSec Experienced Pentester (OSEP)_
> - _OffSec Web Assessor (OSWA)_
> - _Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT)_
> - _Web Application Penetration Tester (eWPT)_
> - _Web Application Penetration Tester eXtreme (eWPTX)_
> - _Hack the Box Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (HTB CPTS)_
> - _Burp Suite Certified Practitioner_

**Impact and Rational:** 3PAOs indicated that it was critical for their
organizations to align FedRAMP personnel certification requirements with other
major government compliance programs to allow maximum flexibility for how they
staff assessments.

### Requirement 6.1.1 F.4:

The certification requirements for the junior assessor role were removed.

**Impact and Rationale:** 3PAOs indicated that a more cost effective approach to
train their junior assessor personnel was for their organizations to develop a
robust FedRAMP-specific organizational training program (see Appendix A below).
Additionally, by not requiring specific certifications for their junior assessor
staff, 3PAOs have more flexibility to hire junior level assessors and have them
immediately support assessments under the supervision of their senior assessor
leads.

### Requirement 6.1.5 F.1:

3PAO organizational training program requirements were further defined to
include specific FedRAMP knowledge areas for all personnel who perform FedRAMP
assessments. These specific FedRAMP knowledge areas are mentioned in Appendix A
below.

> 3PAOs must develop an organizational training program for _all_ its personnel
> _(not only specific to the “senior assessor” and “penetration tester” roles)_
> including content incorporating continuing professional education (CPE)
> credits for _the_ FedRAMP _knowledge areas specified in Appendix A._ Training
> shall comprise a minimum of 6 hours for each of the FedRAMP knowledge areas
> _mentioned in Appendix A_. 3PAOs must maintain a list of all training courses
> planned for the year and a statement for each item on the list as to how the
> training is related to these knowledge areas. The training plan must be based
> on the employee role in the assessment team and shall clearly delineate the
> intent of the plan for that individual role. The overall organizational
> training program will be analyzed to determine if there is sufficient
> technical training of assessors for understanding FedRAMP.

**Impact and Rationale:** 3PAOs indicated that a more cost effective approach to
train their junior assessor personnel is for their organizations to develop a
robust FedRAMP-specific internal training program based on knowledge areas
prescribed by FedRAMP. This training program will provide specific elements that
FedRAMP requires 3PAO personnel to be trained on based on common issue areas
found in 3PAO assessment deliverables and establishes a level of training
consistency across all 3PAOs in the program.

### Requirement 6.1.5 F.2:

The number required annual training hours for 3PAO personnel was reduced from 32
to 24 hours.

> All authorized 3PAO personnel must complete at least _24_ hours of training
> annually under the training program detailed in 6.1.5 F.1. These training
> hours may be completed through other accreditation programs with the
> completion of Continuing Professional Education (CPEs) or equivalent, as long
> as the hours are defined adequately within 6.1.5 F.1, above. The sign off on
> successful completion of the CPEs is required and records shall be maintained.
> Also, the _24_ hours of training annually is in addition to the mandatory
> training released by FedRAMP.

**Impact and Rationale:** 3PAOs expressed concern that 32 hours of individual
personnel training was overly burdensome for their organizations financially,
especially for organizations with large teams, due to also being required to
maintain personnel certifications and BCR proficiency training. As an
alternative, 3PAOs will need to implement a more structured internal training
program for all of their personnel that incorporates FedRAMP-specific knowledge
areas as specified in Appendix A below.

### Appendix A FedRAMP Focus Areas for 3PAO Organizational Training Program:

Four (4) FedRAMP focus areas were defined as a basis for the development of an
internal 3PAO training program.

**Impact and Rationale:** This internal training program will provide specific
elements that FedRAMP requires 3PAO personnel to be trained on based on common
issue areas found in 3PAO assessment deliverables and establishes a level of
training consistency across all 3PAOs in the program.
