## Summary

This draft policy opens discussion on clarifications for the documentation and
assessment of the FedRAMP boundary and the reuse of FedRAMP authorized cloud
service offerings by cloud service providers.

> Draft guidance released in the FedRAMP Request for Comment (RFC) process
> should not be considered formal or finalized. The initial public comment
> period for this draft will be 30 days. Depending on the outcome of this
> comment period, there may be further rounds of public comment after additional
> edits. Once public comment is concluded, FedRAMP’s goal will be to finalize
> this policy with the FedRAMP Board within two months.

This draft policy indicates that the FedRAMP boundary must include all services
that:

1. handle federal information; and/or
2. directly impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal
   information

Services not meeting the above criteria should be excluded from the FedRAMP
boundary with appropriate justification and risk-based review. Ancillary
services whose compromise would pose negligible risk to federal information or
federal information systems are explicitly outside the scope of FedRAMP.

## Motivation

The assessment of cloud service offerings under FedRAMP should be limited,
wherever possible and appropriate, to systems and services whose compromise
would pose a risk to the security of federal information. The inclusion of
ancillary services with negligible impact on federal information in the FedRAMP
boundary creates an unnecessary burden on cloud service providers, third party
assessment organizations, and government agencies during the initial
authorization and ongoing monitoring of cloud service offerings. This increased
burden may result in reduced effective security as effort is spread across
disparate systems that pose negligible risk; effort should instead be focused
explicitly on the aspects of a cloud service offering that pose meaningful risk.

External services that pose meaningful risk to federal information must be
included in the FedRAMP boundary, but the reuse of FedRAMP authorized external
services should be incentivized to reduce duplication of effort. Only
documentation and assessment of the configuration or customer implementation (as
defined in the Customer Responsibility Matrix) of a FedRAMP authorized external
service should be required. Agency review teams should separately review the
underlying security of external cloud services with FedRAMP authorizations for a
complete risk picture when making an authorization decision.

## Explanation

The full draft policy is approximately six pages and is available for review as
follows:

- [Basic web formatting on fedramp.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/rfcs/0004)
- [Basic text markdown in this repository](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfc0004-boundary-policy/blob/main/rfc/assets/0004-boundary-policy.md)
- [PDF file: 0004-boundary-policy.pdf](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfc0004-boundary-policy/blob/main/rfc/assets/0004-boundary-policy.pdf)
- [Word file: 0004-boundary-policy.docx](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfc0004-boundary-policy/raw/refs/heads/main/rfc/assets/0004-boundary-policy.docx)

This draft policy does not include examples; updates and clarifications are
expected in the public comment and agency review process. There will be multiple
iterations on this policy during this process, with examples to be provided once
an initial version is adopted as formal policy.

## Discussion Requested

FedRAMP stakeholders will be impacted differently by separate areas of this
proposed update to how cloud service offering boundaries should be determined
and assessed. These changes are intended to decrease the burden of FedRAMP
authorization while increasing the focus on the security of the highest risk
aspects of cloud services.

FedRAMP seeks to understand how these changes would impact varying sets of
stakeholders and what additional changes and clarifications would be recommended
to find the right balance between security, cost, and complexity for all
parties.

FedRAMP also encourages the public to provide example scenarios during public
comment periods to clearly highlight where and how this guidance can be
clarified in future knowledge base articles.

### Editorial Comments

1. This policy explicitly limits the FedRAMP boundary to a subset of the full
   traditional authorization boundary. If a SaaS offering runs on a FedRAMP
   authorized PaaS then both the SaaS offering and the aspects of the PaaS used
   by the SaaS offering would be inside the agency Authorization to Operate
   boundary but the FedRAMP authorization will only include the SaaS offering
   and its configuration of the PaaS. This is difficult to convey effectively in
   general due to the many dimensions of reuse. Examples are recommended, but
   how can this be standardized clearly without examples?\_

   _Ex: Control MP-06 (Media Protection, Media Sanitization) requires that media
   be sanitized prior to disposal. A SaaS CSO does not need to address the
   implementation of MP-06 by the FedRAMP authorized PaaS it is leveraging, but
   may need to address MP-06 implementations for laptops used by site
   reliability engineers managing the SaaS CSO. Agencies issuing an ATO for the
   SaaS CSO would need to review the full MP-06 implementation from the
   underlying PaaS to make an appropriate risk assessment for transferring data
   into the SaaS CSO, however._

2. This draft introduces the plain language idea of “handling” federal
   information as inherently inclusive of everything one can do with information
   without continuously providing a long list of verbs (“create, collect,
   process, store, transmit, access, maintain, use, disseminate, disclose,
   dispose, etc.”). Is this sufficiently clear?

3. FRR211: This rule is intended to convey that restrictions on external
   connections may not be used by a cloud service provider to deny access to the
   owner of federal information in a cloud service offering. A cloud service
   offering may allow agency authorized services to interconnect with the cloud
   service offering and only needs to document the relevant mechanisms within
   the cloud service offering. For example, if a cloud service offering allows
   authenticated API access to information, then any system used by the agency
   to access that information is outside the FedRAMP boundary but not prevented
   under this rule. This is a difficult process rule to communicate. Providing
   comment on improving clarity here would be appreciated.
