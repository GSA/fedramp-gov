fed-authorize-header: FedRAMP Authorization Process
fed-authorize-text: If you have a Cloud Service Offering (CSO) that is in use by the federal government, you should be thinking about obtaining a FedRAMP authorization. Per an OMB memorandum, any cloud services that hold federal data must be FedRAMP authorized. There are two ways to authorize a cloud service through FedRAMP&#58; a Joint Authorization Board (JAB) provisional authorization (P-ATO), and through individual Agencies.
marketplace-text: The FedRAMP Marketplace provides a searchable, sortable database of cloud offerings that have achieved a FedRAMP designation.
csp-header: Are you a CSP and don ºt know where to start?
csp-text: To get started with FedRAMP, CSPs interested in pursing an authorization should complete a CSP Information Form. Completing this form will trigger the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) to set up an intake call to discuss your system and the best authorization strategy for you.
