<p>The Plan of Actions & Milestones (POA&M) is a key document in the security authorization package and for continuous monitoring activities. The POA&M facilitates a disciplined and structured approach to tracking risk mitigation activities. The POA&M includes security findings for the system from continuous monitoring activities and periodic security assessments such as the Annual Assessment. A POA&M describes the current disposition of any discovered vulnerabilities and system findings, and includes a CSP’s intended corrective actions for those findings. Agency AOs or designees are responsible for reviewing and approving POA&Ms, making their own risk-based decision both at the time of the initial assessment and during ConMon.  </p>
<p>FedRAMP uses the POA&M to monitor the CSP’s progress in correcting these findings. A CSP applying for a FedRAMP JAB P-ATO, or a FedRAMP Agency ATO, must establish and maintain a POA&M for their system in accordance with the POA&M Template Completion Guide using the FedRAMP POA&M Template.  The POA&M includes the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific weaknesses or deficiencies in deployed security controls and the source of the identified weakness</li>
<li>Severity of the identified security control weaknesses or deficiencies</li>
<li>Scope or affected assets of the weakness in components within the environment</li>
<li>Proposed risk mitigation approach to address the identified weaknesses or deficiencies in the security control implementations (e.g., prioritization of risk mitigation actions and allocation of risk mitigation resources)</li>
<li>Any deviation request status</li>
</ul>
