The FedRAMP PMO provides hands-on training opportunities with in-depth focus on specific topics for all audiences. These customized training events are intended to meet our stakeholder’s real time needs. 

<h2>ISSO Training </h2>
<p>Open to Federal Agency Information System Security Officers (ISSOs), these in-person trainings are based on <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Authorization_Playbook.pdf">FedRAMP’s Agency Authorization Playbook</a> and include a deep dive into each authorization phase. Lead by the PMO’s technical Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), the trainings focus on the FedRAMP security authorization process and provide a collaborative space for ISSOs to review, understand, and discuss best practices and approaches to FedRAMP Agency Authorizations. ISSO trainings are valuable learning opportunities to better equip ISSOs with the knowledge necessary to effectively review FedRAMP authorization packages for cloud services and understand the FedRAMP framework and available resources.</p>
