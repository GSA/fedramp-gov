The FedRAMP PMO provides hands-on training opportunities with in-depth focus on specific topics for all audiences. These customized training events are intended to meet our stakeholder’s real time needs. 

<h2>ISSO Training </h2>
<p>Open to Federal Agency Information System Security Officers (ISSOs), these in-person trainings breakdown the FedRAMP Agency Authorization process, providing “deep-dives” into FedRAMP deliverables and processes. Trainings focus on best practices and lessons learned for completing an Agency authorization and are designed to equip ISSOs with the knowledge and resources necessary to best authorize cloud services. Facilitated by FedRAMP Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and practitioners from trusted Agency partners, ISSO trainings are valuable opportunities for Agency ISSOs to network and learn in a collaborative environment.</p>
