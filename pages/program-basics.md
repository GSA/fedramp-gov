<h2>History of FedRAMP</h2>
<p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) was established in 2011 to provide a cost-effective, risk-based approach for the adoption and use of cloud services by the Federal Government. The PMO empowers agencies to implement secure cloud solutions, improve the protection of information, and streamline and reduce the cost of security assessments. FedRAMP provides the required documentation and guidance for cloud services to comply with White House and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requirements.</p>
