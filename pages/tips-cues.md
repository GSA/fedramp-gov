Many of our Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), Federal Agencies, and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) share common issues and questions when going through the FedRAMP process. To help guide our stakeholders, we provide weekly tips and address frequently asked questions and concerns. Below you will find our most recent month of Tips & Cues. To receive our weekly email, sign up [here](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USGSA/subscriber/new?qsp=USGSA_2224) for our listserv.

<h2>December 2018 & January 2019 Tips & Cues</h2>

<div class="q3">
<h3>Q: What does FedRAMP Ready status mean? Is it a requirement for CSPs who would like to pursue an Agency authorization?</h3>
<p>
A: FedRAMP Ready is a designation intended to demonstrate a CSP's ability to complete the full FedRAMP Authorization process. It is a mandatory step in pursuing a JAB Provisional Authorization to Operate (P-ATO) and is optional for those pursuing an Agency-based FedRAMP Authorization. Although it is optional for Agencies, some Agencies may prefer to work with CSPs that are "FedRAMP Ready" since it offers key insight into their capabilities and ability to achieve an authorization.</p>
 <p>
The FedRAMP Authorization process is rigorous and intensive. It involves a lot of hard work and effort, so it makes sense that a CSP would want some assurance that their cloud offering is likely to attain authorization. This is why reaching "FedRAMP Ready" is an important first step in the FedRAMP process.

<h3>TIP: Be consistent with your naming conventions. Always call the same thing by the same name throughout your written work.</h3>
<p>
EXAMPLE: "The Emergency Response Team shall resolve all problems within four hours of receiving a report. Once a problem is fixed, the response team lead documents the solution and sends the requesting team the correction report." This sentence calls "The Emergency Response Team" by another name, "response team." These are probably the same, but the different names and differing capitalization can be confusing. Additionally, what the Emergency Response Team does is referred to with three different verbs: resolve, fix, and correct. Stick to one name and try to stick to one verb that accurately describes the action.

<h3>Q: How should a CSP address platform scope within the System Security Plan (SSP)?</h3>
<p>
A: There are multiple platforms/platform groups in a system as identified by the inventory. A platform has certain controls (e.g., access controls, audit logging, session lock, etc.) configured uniquely for each device type. It is expected that unique implementations would be addressed by platform for the following controls/control families where applicable: AC, IA, AU, CM, SI-2, SI-3, SI-5, SI-11. We recommend using a standard format for addressing controls by platform (e.g., have a sub header within the control part/parts for “Cisco,” “Brocade,” etc.).

<h3>Q: What types of databases are required to be scanned and how should they be tested?</h3>
<p>
A: The database scanning or manual testing requirements apply to all databases within the security boundary (i.e., those that reside/are embedded in a host/application as well as other databases). Databases that reside in a host (such as an appliance) need to be tested and may require the tester to work with the relevant vendor to ensure the appropriate security posture of the database that resides in a host is secure. If the databases are not accessible by the scanners, alternate methods of database testing (such as manual tests) should be explored. The host on which the databases reside should be scanned as part of the infrastructure scanning.

<div class="q3">
<h3>TIP: When submitting the monthly Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&M) spreadsheet, the findings on the spreadsheet must be reconciled each month with the scan results to ensure POA&M accuracy. This means that any items that have closed throughout the month should be marked as such and appropriate artifacts should be provided to validate closure.
 </h3>
<p>
All findings must be recorded on the open tab of the POA&M. A false positive (FP) vulnerability remains in the open tab until the deviation request (DR) is approved. An operationally required (OR) vulnerability remains on the open tab indefinitely and is only closed if the circumstances creating the OR are resolved, such as migration to a new technology. A vendor dependency also remains on the open tab indefinitely and is only closed once the CSP resolves the issue by applying a vendor approved fix or upgrade.

<h3>Q: Our CSP client has data centers in multiple locations throughout the United States. As part of the Readiness Assessment Report (RAR), FedRAMP requires in-person interviews. Does visiting one data center satisfy FedRAMP’s requirement, or do we need to visit each location?</h3>
<p>
A: Visiting data centers is a best practice to enable you to view the security at the facility first-hand as part of your verification and validation efforts. If a CSP has multiple data centers, you are not required to visit each one as part of the RAR effort; however, during the Security Assessment Report (SAR) phase, we expect the 3PAO to visit each data center to perform in-person interviews, review documents as necessary, and validate some of the controls. Most CSPs remotely manage their systems, and the 3PAO needs to validate that the security capabilities are actually in place.
