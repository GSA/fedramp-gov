Many of our Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), Federal Agencies, and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) share common issues and questions when going through the FedRAMP process. To help guide our stakeholders, we provide weekly tips and address frequently asked questions and concerns. Below you will find our most recent month of Tips & Cues. To receive our weekly email, sign up [here](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USGSA/subscriber/new?qsp=USGSA_2224) for our listserv.

<h3>Audience: Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)</h3>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the purpose of an Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP)?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Each CSP must develop and maintain contingency plans to address operational disruptions. The contingency plan (and test results) provides management with an evaluation of the preparedness of the CSP's cloud service offering in the event of a major disruption and/or a catastrophic event. The contingency plan ensures that operations resume and are eventually restored to a known state. The ISCP and Service Level Agreements drive the recovery test frequency and complexity and recovery time frames. These contingency plans are a component of an effective security operations implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What can a CSP do to prepare for penetration testing and what risks are involved?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The FedRAMP Penetration Testing Methodology is comprehensive and follows NIST SP 800-115. Before considering this activity, a CSP should work with a third party assessment organization (3PAO) assessment team to discuss the ramifications of utilizing the FedRAMP Penetration Testing Methodology. Both the 3PAO assessment team and the CSP must determine, in writing and prior to the onset of the testing, the level of risk they are willing to accept for the assessment and tailor the approach accordingly.</p>

<p>Once the parameters have been tentatively agreed upon, the 3PAO penetration tester and assessment team should begin the security assessment activities with a planning phase that includes gathering information about the CSP environment and developing the test procedures. Only after completing the planning phase should the 3PAO assessment team proceed to the execution phase.</p>

<p>During execution phase, the assessment team identifies vulnerabilities and validates that the vulnerabilities are not false positives. At the conclusion of the execution phase, the assessment team has a list of technical and process vulnerabilities. This list is used during the post-execution phase to determine root causes of vulnerabilities, recommend remediation actions, and document the test results in the Security Assessment Report (SAR).</p>

<p>Penetration testing risks can range from not gathering sufficient information on the organization’s security posture for fear of impacting system functionality to affecting the system or network availability by executing techniques without the proper safeguards in place. Communication and thorough understanding is key.</p>

<h3>Audience: Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)</h3>
<div class="tip-1">
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> When submitting the monthly Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&M) spreadsheet, the findings on the spreadsheet must be reconciled each month with the scan results to ensure POA&M accuracy. This means that any items that have closed throughout the month should be marked as such and appropriate artifacts should be provided to validate closure.</p>

<p>All findings must be recorded on the open tab of the POA&M. A false positive (FP) vulnerability remains in the open tab until the deviation request (DR) is approved. An operationally required (OR) vulnerability remains on the open tab indefinitely and is only closed if the circumstances creating the OR are resolved, such as migration to a new technology. A vendor dependency also remains on the open tab indefinitely and is only closed once the CSP resolves the issue by applying a vendor approved fix or upgrade.</p>

<h3>Audience: Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)</h3>
<div class="q3">
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Our CSP client has data centers in multiple locations throughout the United States. As part of the Readiness Assessment Report (RAR), FedRAMP requires in-person interviews. Does visiting one data center satisfy FedRAMP’s requirement, or do we need to visit each location?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Visiting data centers is a best practice to enable you to view the security at the facility first-hand as part of your verification and validation efforts. If a CSP has multiple data centers, you are not required to visit each one as part of the RAR effort; however, during the Security Assessment Report (SAR) phase, we expect the 3PAO to visit each data center to perform in-person interviews, review documents as necessary, and validate some of the controls. Most CSPs remotely manage their systems, and the 3PAO needs to validate that the security capabilities are actually in place.</p>

<h2>December 6th, 2017</h2>

<h3>Audience: Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)</h3>
<div class="q4">

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I referenced a document in my System Security Plan (SSP), but did not provide the referenced document because it contains proprietary or sensitive information. How will this affect my review?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Every attempt should be made to prevent this situation. The assessment package should stand on its own without referencing documents that require complex retrieval, which can be confusing, time consuming, and cause delays in the assessment. In the rare circumstance this can’t be avoided, you might add a statement that says, "The document is available onsite for review upon request or as required for audits and assessments."</p>
</div>
<h3>Audience: Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)</h3>
<div class="q5">

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are low risk findings tracked on the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)? If so, what is the time window to correct low risk findings? The FedRAMP guidance only states remediation time frames for high/moderate risk items.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, all findings must be documented in the POA&M, including low risk findings. Low risk findings should be remediated within 180 days, and the remediation will be validated during the next annual assessment.</p>
