Many of our Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), Federal Agencies, and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) share common issues and questions when going through the FedRAMP process. To help guide our stakeholders, we provide weekly tips and address frequently asked questions and concerns. Below you will find our most recent month of Tips & Cues. To receive our weekly email, sign up [here](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USGSA/subscriber/new?qsp=USGSA_2224) for our listserv.

<h2>September 2018 Tips & Cues</h2>

<div class="q3">
<h3>TIP: Submitting an Operational Requirement Deviation Request (DR) is typically acceptable when updating the host would break FIPS compliance.</h3>
<p>
However, it is critical that CSPs continuously re-evaluate FIPS certification to determine when updates become FIPS compliant. Consequently, the Operational Requirements would no longer be relevant.

<h3>TIP: Do not automatically assume that an N/A assertion from an IaaS/Paas can be inherited by a SaaS, even if the SaaS does not implement the relevant features.</h3>
<p>
The SaaS may also assert the control as N/A, but they need to provide their own rationale, not rely on the underlying IaaS/PaaS assertion. AC-19 Access Control for Mobile Devices comes to mind. This may be N/A for the IaaS, but in-scope for the SaaS. Thus, it would need to be addressed for the SaaS.

<h3>TIP: For significant change requests, make sure to describe in detail what is expected to be new and different in the environment.</h3>
<p>
It is important to detail all of the changes that affect the security posture of the system. This ensures that both the Authorizing Official (AOs)/Joint Authorization Board (JAB) reviewers and 3PAO know what will be required to assess the change. Missing information may result in the need for additional testing and delays.

<div class="q3">
<h3>TIP: When inserting a diagram or graphic into a document, pleasure make sure that the content can be viewed.</h3>
<p>
It is acceptable for the graphic to require magnification to be readable, but the author must ensure that the magnified graphic resolves into readable content, not just a fuzzy expansion of the smaller graphic. Diagrams or graphics that require significant detail should be provided in an alternative format that can be reviewed by the Authorizing Official (AO) or the Joint Authorization Board (JAB).

<div class="q3">
<h3>TIP: During Continuous Monitoring, the Agency Authorizing Official (AO) is responsible for ensuring that the security posture of the cloud service their Agency is using continues to be acceptable.</h3>
<p>
The responsibility for the AO (or his/her designated representative) includes reviewing the system security artifacts provided by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP), Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), and FedRAMP PMO (in the case of services with a JAB P-ATO) for both granting the authorization and during continuous monitoring. The AO should have confidence that the security posture of the service is maintained in good standing for ongoing authorization.

<div class="q3">
<h3>Q: Can I use the FedRAMP Significant Change Request (SCR) form for multiple significant changes?</h3>
<p>
A: Yes, you can include multiple significant changes as long as all changes will be implemented for assessment at the same time. We often see SCRâ€™s for multiple changes where the CSP is on-boarding multiple new services, tech-refresh of multiple component types and others. The assumption is that testing for all of the new services and components will be performed under a single Security Assessment Plan (SAP) and the results will be reflected in a single Security Assessment Report (SAR).
