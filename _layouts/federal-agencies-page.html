					<h2>FedRAMP Authorization: An Agency’s Perspective</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="full-col desktop:grid-col-6 intro-text">
					<p>Agencies are required by law to protect any federal information that is collected, maintained, processed, disseminated, or disposed of by cloud service offerings, in accordance with <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf" target="_blank">FedRAMP requirements</a>.</p>
					
					<p>FedRAMP provides a standardized framework to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This framework uses a “do once, use many” approach that eliminates duplicative efforts.</p>

								<h3>Selecting a CSO</h3>
								<p>Agencies should begin by defining their mission needs and specific requirements for a Cloud Service Offering (CSO), and research potential providers. We recommend agencies first check the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products">FedRAMP Marketplace</a>, a searchable, sortable, database of CSOs that have achieved a FedRAMP designation, to see if there is a CSO that meets their needs that has already <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products?status=In%20Process&sort=productName">started the FedRAMP process</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products?status=Compliant&sort=productName">is authorized</a>.</p>
								
								<p>Prior to engaging a Cloud Service Provider (CSP), it is important that agencies understand their technical requirements, to include determination of the type of cloud service/scope of services needed, cloud deployment model, data sensitivities, and other pertinent information.</p>

								<h4>Interested in a CSO that is already FedRAMP Authorized?</h4>
								<p>Request access to their package through the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Package_Request_Form.pdf">Package Request Form</a>, and review the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Reusing_Authorizations_for_Cloud_Products_Quick_Guide.pdf">Reusing Authorizations for Cloud Products Quick Guide</a>.</p>
								
								<h4>Interested in a CSO that is In Process?</h4>
								
								<p>Inquire about their status by contacting the CSP directly, or emailing <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>.</p>
								
								<h4>Interested in using a CSO that is not yet FedRAMP Authorized or FedRAMP In Process?</h4>
								
								<p>Contact the PMO to learn more about how to partner with a CSP to issue a FedRAMP authorization. We recommend reviewing our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Authorization_Playbook.pdf">Agency Authorization Playbook</a> for more information on the Initial Authorization process.</p>
								
								<h4>Having difficulty selecting a CSO?</h4>
								<p>Reach out to <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>. The PMO can help to discuss options and share lessons learned from other agencies.</p>

								<h3>Getting Authorized</h3>
								<p>The initial authorization process begins with a kick-off meeting with all stakeholders. Following the kick-off, a Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) conducts a security assessment of the CSO and the results of the security assessment are included in a FedRAMP authorization package. A FedRAMP authorization package documents a cloud service offering’s (CSO) system security and provides&#58;</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Complete system description</li>
									<li>Complete detail of the system’s security control implementation</li>
									<li>Overview of the system’s security assessment scope and methodology</li>
									<li>Security assessment report that qualifies whether the system should be used by a federal agency</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h4>Agency’s role in authorization&#58;</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Review the security authorization package, which includes&#58;</li>
											<ul>
												<li>System Security Plan (SSP) detailing the CSP’s system security environment</li>
												<li>System Assessment Plan (SAP) detailing the security assessment scope and methodology</li>
												<li>System Assessment Report (SAR) detailing the security assessment results</li>
												<li>Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&M) detailing the CSP’s remediation plan and timeline for any remaining open risks</li>
											</ul>	
										<li>Understand and agree to agency-responsible controls</li>
										<li>Communicate any additional requirements for agency mission/business needs</li>
										<li>Communicate any system weaknesses or vulnerabilities that cannot be risk-accepted</li>
										<li>Perform final review of a security authorization package, with a focus toward</li><li>understanding the risk posture the agency must accept by using the cloud service</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>Reviewing a Security Package</h3>
								
								<p>For an initial authorization, there are two approaches to reviewing a FedRAMP security package&#58; (1) Just-in-Time and (2) All Deliverables Simultaneously.</p>
								
								<h4>Approach 1&#58; Just-In-Time</h4>
								<p>The CSP and 3PAO provide the security documents to the agency for review and approval as they are prepared, creating an agile workflow for the evaluation of a system’s security and assessment. A Just-In-Time approach is recommended for agencies and CSPs new to the FedRAMP process.</p>
								
								<h4>Approach 2&#58; All Deliverable Simultaneously</h4>
								<p>The CSP and 3PAO provide the agency a complete security package at once, upon completion. This approach is most appropriate for agencies that have mature cloud security programs in place and prior experience with FedRAMP.</p> 
								
								<p>In either approach, FedRAMP encourages agencies to establish a cadence of frequent touchpoints with their partnered CSP(s) to understand progress against milestones and iteratively review documentation.</p>
								
								<p>For authorization reuse, agencies should review the security materials and continuous monitoring deliverables and determine if the CSP needs to meet additional security requirements due to agency data types/mission/business needs. </p>
								
								<h3>Issuing an ATO</h3>
								<p>An agency’s Authorizing Official (AO) is responsible for making a risk-based decision to grant an Authority to Operate (ATO) for the agency’s use of the CSO. To issue an ATO for a cloud service offering that is already FedRAMP Authorized, agencies should&#58;</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Conduct a risk analysis by reviewing the CSP’s authorization package</li>
									<li>Determine if the risk posture is acceptable</li>
									<li>Determine if the CSP needs to meet additional requirements for agency mission/business needs</li>
									<li>Approve the CSP package for authorization</li>
									<li>Issue an ATO for the CSO</li>
									<li>Send the ATO letter to the FedRAMP PMO at <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a></li>
								</ul>

								<p>A complete ATO letter should explicitly state the AO’s acceptance of&#58;</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Use of the system at the agency at the determined FIPS 199 impact level</li>
									<li>Any conditions, exceptions or exclusions of the CSO to be considered for use at the Agency</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>For an initial authorization, once an agency grants an ATO, the FedRAMP PMO reviews the security package to determine suitability for government-wide reuse. Once the FedRAMP PMO determines the security package is acceptable, the CSP is granted a FedRAMP Authorization and the designation is reflected on the FedRAMP Marketplace. Other agencies can utilize FedRAMP’s reuse model to issue their own ATO for their use of the CSO. The reuse model allows agencies to review a CSO’s security package, make a risk-based decision on the use of that system, and issue their own ATO.</p>

								<h3>Continuous Monitoring</h3>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="full-row grid-row grid-gap">
							<div class="full-col desktop:grid-col-6">
								<p>Each agency must ensure the risk posture that was agreed upon at the time of authorization remains consistent throughout the lifecycle of the system at that agency. Continuous monitoring of a cloud system includes monthly meetings between the agency and CSP to review a system’s high-level transaction reports, security scans, and updated POA&amp;M. Agencies should also assess CSPs annually, reviewing details about system changes and updates, and ensuring compliance with the originally accepted risk posture. Agency AOs should review a CSP’s Annual Assessment and upload it to OMB MAX.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="desktop:grid-col-6 callout-box padding-4">
								<p>As part of continuous monitoring, FedRAMP recommends the following best practices:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Perform system scanning at least monthly, with a recommendation for even greater frequency (CSPs and Agencies should define and agree to a monthly meeting cadence early in the Authorization process. )</li>
									<li>Require the CSP to seek approval following monthly and annual assessments as an operational requirement (OR) for continued use of the system</li>
									<li>Conduct remediation of system vulnerabilities</li>
									<ul style="list-style: none;">
										<li><strong>within 30 days</strong> of discovery of high and critical vulnerabilities</li>
										<li><strong>within 90 days</strong> of discovery for moderate vulnerabilities</li>
										<li><strong>within 180 days</strong> of discovery for low vulnerabilities.</li>
									</ul>
