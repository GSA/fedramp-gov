			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
			<p>The significant change pilot: new services and features will engage with CSPs, with approval from their AOs, who have mature automated configuration management and change management processes to examine the deployment of new services and features without independent testing or agency approval.</p>

			<p>CSPs will follow their policies and procedures, as well as the FedRAMP change management requirements outlined in the FedRAMP baselines for new service and feature  onboarding. The data gathered will help inform FedRAMP program-wide changes that focus on risk management inside change and configuration management processes. The intent of the pilot is to ensure that agencies can leverage the latest services and features while removing the roadblocks for CSPs to bring them to market.</p>

			<p>The pilot will inform agencies on the addition of new services or features and provide visibility to the security impacts and the artifacts that show the service or feature’s adherence to existing security controls. The pilot will inform FedRAMP on the best practices and requirements for configuration and change management that CSPs maintain for their security posture while providing the latest versions of their products to the agencies.</p>

			<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
			<p>The initial pilot will be limited to onboarding of new services and features that would be opt-in. They should not be required for the rest of the offering to function, and agencies can decide not to use each of these services and features. Changes that involve underlying architecture changes and/or new security control implementations for the entire offering will be excluded from the pilot. </p>
			<h3 id="goals-and-objectives">Goals and Objectives</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify examples of high-quality practices that allow for the deployment of new features without agency review or independent assessment.</li>
				<li>Identify proposed changes to the existing significant change request (SCR) process based on the pilot.</li>
				<li>Identify updates to guidance on non-blocking SCRs for CSPs, independent auditors, and agencies.</li>
				<li>Gather information during the pilot that the PMO will use to inform enhancements to the FedRAMP automation strategy and to identify opportunities to create automated detection and validation of changes.</li>
			</ul>

		<div id="expectations-for-the-SCR-pilot" class="margin-top-2">
			<h2>Expectations for the SCR Pilot</h2>
			<h3 id="SCR-pilot-prerequisites">SCR Pilot Prerequisites</h3>
			<p>A CSP must meet the following prerequisites before applying to participate in the pilot:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Have one or more new services or features they plan to deploy during the pilot period that will be opt-in for agencies.</li>
				<li>Have mature, automated, and well-documented configuration and change management plans.</li>
				<li>Have mature configuration and change management procedures that implement automated mechanisms for deploying services and features and verifying their secure implementation.</li>
				<li>Be willing to share their mature processes and plans as examples for the FedRAMP knowledge base.</li>
				<li>Be in good standing with no open CAPs that are due to issues with the CSP’s configuration management controls or past incidents of failing to follow existing SCR processes.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="pilot-application-process">Pilot Application Process</h3>
			<p>To apply, a CSP must complete the linked pilot application form with their contact information.</p>

			<p>The CSP must also make the following available in its “SCR Pilot” folder as part of the application process. (Note: For systems that use FedRAMP Connect, the PMO will create an “SCR Pilot” folder in their CSP submissions folder. CSPs with their own secure repository will need to create an “SCR Pilot” folder.)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Configuration management plan, which should describe the automated configuration management and validation and deployment mechanisms implemented within the CSO, as well as the security impact analysis processes and supporting technologies, and the change approval process and any automated mechanisms </li>
				<li>Their latest POA&M, inventory, and scans</li>
				<li>Their latest SSP</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="pilot-selection-process">Pilot Selection Process</h3>
			<p>The FedRAMP PMO will review all applications and identify CSPs for further engagement and discussion based on the following criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The maturity and level of automation present within their configuration management plans, and their value as knowledge base examples. </li>
				<li>Current security posture and historical challenges with change and configuration management; for example, the CSP’s ability to make changes without external oversight or significant external consultation, or the CSP’s regular use of internal red or purple teaming as part of new product rollout or deployment.</li>
				<li>Diverse representation of participants, including to the extent possible small and large businesses and different cloud service deployment models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).</li>
				<li>Unique or innovative approaches to change or configuration management.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="pilot-kickoff-process">Pilot Kickoff Process</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The PMO will notify CSPs who are accepted into the pilot.</li>
				<li>The PMO will schedule a 30-minute kickoff meeting with each pilot participant.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="pilot-evaluation-process">Pilot Evaluation Process</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The PMO will review collected cost data and report to stakeholders the value proposition of implementing the automated SCR approval processes.</li>
				<li>The PMO will compare each CSP’s self-assessment results against those performed by an independent assessor and report to each CSP their successes and areas of improvement in the SIA processes. </li>
				<li>The PMO will examine the independent assessments to identify significant vulnerabilities, and analyze their causes and possible mitigations to prevent significant vulnerabilities from being introduced by future service or feature onboarding. </li>
				<li>The PMO will analyze pilot participants to identify innovative technology or processes that increased the effectiveness of CSPs’ change management programs. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="potential-next-steps">Potential Next Steps</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The PMO will evaluate the program, including characteristics of successful change management programs, and make updates to guidance and training for CSPs.</li>
				<li>The PMO, based on the evaluation of the pilot, may decide to expand the pilot for general use.</li>
				<li>The PMO may identify other pilots for the SCR processes that would continue to identify areas of improvement and cost and resource savings. </li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div id="SCR-change-process-for-CSP-participants" class="margin-top-2">
			<h2>SCR Change Process for CSP Participants</h2>
			<p>CSPs participating in the pilot are expected to follow the process below for each new service or feature they add as part of the pilot:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pre-Deployment</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Document the new service or feature within the SSP, including control statements, data flow diagrams, and architectural diagrams.</li>
					<li>Document how agencies can opt-in to use of the new service or feature.</li>
					<li>Fill out an SCR, including the security impact analysis that identifies the impacted controls section. The SCR must be submitted to the PMO and AO prior to the CSP making the change. Note that the SCR will not be reviewed for approval before changes, but will be analyzed during the assessment to ensure that the CSP identifies all the impacted controls and has properly documented all changes. </li>
				</ul>
				<li>Production Deployment</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Implement the new service or feature.</li>
					<li>Do internal testing and validation of the deployment. </li>
					<li>Review and update any operational requirements that extend to the new service or feature, including validating that any mitigations are in place.</li>
					<li>Gather all artifacts that validate the secure implementation of the service or feature.</li>
					<li>Upload all artifacts that demonstrate the secure implementation of the service or feature. CSPs must provide evidence of the secure implementation of all services or features that are onboarded. These will be analyzed by the PMO and authorizing agency during the pilot to ensure compliance with the FedRAMP requirements and the CSP’s configuration and change management processes.</li>
					<li>Record all vulnerabilities identified as part of the change on their POA&M, indicating the new service or feature name and SCR pilot in the Service Name field. </li>
				</ul>
				<li>Post-Deployment</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Notify FedRAMP and the AO that the change has been completed and upload updated inventory, scans, and POA&M to their documentation repository.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>Throughout the pilot period, CSPs must submit their vulnerability scans, inventory, and POA&M monthly. These should be uploaded to their “Vulnerability Scans” folder in either FedRAMP Connect or their secure repository. The vulnerability scans must be in a machine-readable format, and the inventory and POA&M must be in the latest format.</p>

			<p>CSPs must finalize all changes made under the pilot by December 31, 2024.</p>

			<p>Each CSP must have a 3PAO perform testing of all services and features that were deployed as part of the pilot. This may be part of an annual assessment that happens to occur at the appropriate time, or it may be one or more separate specific assessments (preferably one). Each CSP may also perform its own testing during the pilot period but should not submit any reports before the end of the pilot period. The CSP or 3PAO must submit all assessment reports, including SAP and SAR, and all artifacts by the end of the pilot closeout period. Any findings found internally by the CSP or the 3PAO must be included and tracked in the POA&M and must be remediated in accordance with the FedRAMP ConMon Performance Management Guide remediation timelines.</p>

			<p>Failure to follow the process outlined above may result in being removed from the pilot. If there are issues with the process, FedRAMP will be available to assist the CSP in clarifying requirements and expected outcomes. It is important that the participants engage with the PMO to ensure that the pilot identifies the successful elements as well as any opportunities to improve the process. The goal is to identify requirements and best practices that allow CSPs to use their configuration and change management processes to make changes without intervention or approval from the AO, and to consolidate testing into annual assessments to reduce time and cost of doing individual assessments for each change. </p>

			<p>CSPs participating in the pilot should collect data throughout the pilot on cost savings or financial impacts of utilizing the pilot processes for new services and features. This data should include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Projected per-change 3rd-party assessment cost savings</li>
				<li>Projected time savings</li>
				<li>Projected number of changes per year (if new process is adopted)</li>
			</ul>
