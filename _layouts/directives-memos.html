            <p>On Friday, January 19, 2024, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure-vulnerabilities">Emergency Directive 24-01</a>, “Mitigate Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure Vulnerabilities” (the Emergency Directive) and Supplemental Direction on Wednesday, January 31, 2024. The Emergency Directive states the following:</p>
		    
          <blockquote class="directives">CISA has observed widespread and active exploitation of vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure solutions, hereafter referred to as “affected products.” Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities in these affected products allows a malicious threat actor to move laterally, perform data exfiltration, and establish persistent system access, resulting in full compromise of target information systems.</blockquote>
		    
          <blockquote class="directives">CISA has determined these conditions pose an unacceptable risk to Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies and require emergency action. This determination is based on widespread exploitation of vulnerabilities by multiple threat actors, the prevalence of the affected products in the federal enterprise, the high potential for a compromise of agency information systems, the impact of a successful compromise, and the complexity of the proposed mitigations.</blockquote>

<p>In consultation with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and DHS CISA, FedRAMP emphasizes that Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) who maintain federal information fall within the scope defined by <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure-vulnerabilities">Emergency Directive 24-01</a>. Therefore, we request that CSPs:</p>
	
<ol>
	<li>Review and implement the actions described within the Emergency Directive, and</li>
<li>Upload responses, using the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP-Emergency-Directive-24-01-Reporting-Template.xlsx">Emergency Directive 24-01</a> FedRAMP Reporting Template, to the incident response folder in your respective FedRAMP secure repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>CSPs should have uploaded responses, including identifying applicability or negative applicability, by 11:59 PM Eastern Standard Time on Wednesday, January 24, 2024.</p>

<p>In addition, in response to the Supplemental Direction v1, we request that CSPs:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Review and implement the actions described within the Supplemental Direction v1, and</li>
<li>Upload responses, using an updated Emergency Directive 24-01 FedRAMP Reporting Template, to the incident response folder in your respective FedRAMP secure repository.

		<li>Please upload responses for required task 2e in the Supplemental Direction v1 by 1:00PM EST on Monday, February 5, 2024.</li>
  <li>Please upload responses for required task 3 in the Supplemental Direction v1 by 11:59PM EST on Wednesday, February 28, 2024.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>

<p>When these actions are complete, CSPs should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email all agency customer Authorizing Officials (or ISSO), including JAB POCs (if applicable), with notification of the completed action.</li>
<li>Email the FedRAMP PMO with notification of the completed action at info@fedramp.gov using the following convention for your subject line: (CSP NAME | Package ID) - Response to ED 24-01.</li>

          <div id="Moving-the-U.S.-Government-Toward-Zero-Trust-Cybersecurity-Principles" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
            <p>In accordance with Section 8 of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order (EO) 14028 “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity”</a>, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/M-21-31-Improving-the-Federal-Governments-Investigative-and-Remediation-Capabilities-Related-to-Cybersecurity-Incidents.pdf">Memorandum 21-31 “Improving the Federal Government’s Investigative and Remediation Capabilities Related to Cybersecurity Incidents” (M-21-31)</a>. The EO directs agencies to improve their cybersecurity practices through the identification of existing or development of new standards, tools, best practices, and other guidelines. Section 8 focuses primarily on the system logs for both services implemented on servers within the authorization boundary and services deployed on Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs).</p>

            <p>Section 8 of the EO also directs federal agencies to offer more specific instructions for all service providers. M-21-31 fulfills that requirement, and offers additional guidance to agencies around logging, log retention, and log management. Within this guidance, there are four maturity tiers identified, as well as timelines for agencies to mature to certain tiers by certain dates. </p>
            
            <h5>FedRAMP Applicability</h5>

            <p>FedRAMP, in consultation with OMB, assessed that M-21-31 does not apply directly to CSP offerings (unless that CSP is a government system); however, FedRAMP authorized CSOs must comply with M-21-31 by supporting agency implementations within the cloud offering. These requirements are reflected in the FedRAMP Rev. 5 baselines (specifically AC-4 (4), AU-11, and SI-4 (10)). </p>
		  
            <h5>Additional Guidance</h5>

            <p>Further guidance for agencies is included in the bullets below extracted from Section 3 of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">OMB Memorandum 22-09, “Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles”</a>, which is related to and references M-19-26 and M-21-31. </p>
            <p>OMB M-19-26 and OMB M-21-31 – Alternatives to network inspection </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Current OMB policies neither require nor prohibit inline decryption of enterprise network traffic. Agencies are expected to balance the depth of visibility they need with the risks presented by broadly trusted network inspection devices.</li>
              <li>Network traffic that is not decrypted can and should still be analyzed using visible or logged metadata, machine learning techniques, and other heuristics for detecting anomalous activity. This is consistent with the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) initiative, as updated in OMB Memorandum M-19-26, which gives agencies the flexibility to maintain appropriate visibility without needing to perform inline traffic decryption. </li>
              <li>OMB Memorandum M-21-31, “Improving the Federal Government’s Investigative and Remediation Capabilities Related to Cybersecurity Incidents”, describes required fields that agencies must log consistently throughout their enterprise, including packet capture logs. M-21-31 does not require full traffic inspection, but specifies fields that should be captured when such inspection is in place. M-21-31 describes this conditional requirement: </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>IIf agencies perform full traffic inspection through active proxies, they should log additional available fields as described in Appendix C and can work with CISA to implement these capabilities. If agencies do not perform full traffic inspection, they should log the metadata available to them. </p>

The Emergency Directive states the following:</p>

            <blockquote class="directives">Threat actors, including likely advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, are exploiting vulnerabilities (CVE 2022-22954 and CVE 2022-22960) in the following VMWare products: VMware Workspace ONE Access (Access), VMware Identity Manager (vIDM), VMware vRealize Automation (vRA), VMware Cloud Foundation, vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager (impacted VMware products). VMware released an update to address these vulnerabilities on April 6, 2022, and threat actors were able to reverse engineer the update and begin exploitation of impacted VMware products that remained unpatched within 48 hours of the update’s release. </blockquote>

            <p>On May 18, 2022, VMware released an update for two new vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-22972 and CVE-2022-22973). Based on the above, CISA expects threat actors to quickly develop a capability to exploit these newly released vulnerabilities in the same impacted VMware products. Exploiting the above vulnerabilities permits attackers to trigger a server-side template injection that may result in remote code execution (CVE-2022-22954); escalate privileges to 'root' (CVE-2022-22960 and CVE-2022-22973); and obtain administrative access without the need to authenticate (CVE-2022- 22972).</p> 

            <p>As defined by <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities">Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01</a>, CVE 2022-22954 and CVE 2022-22960 were added to CISA’s catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs) on April 14 and April 15, 2022, respectively and updates were required to be applied by May 5, 2022. CISA will continue to monitor for exploitation and will add KEVs to the BOD 22-01 catalog as needed. </p>

            <p>On November 3, 2021, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities">Binding Operational Directive 22-01</a> “Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities” (the Directive). The Directive establishes a CISA-managed <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities</a> that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise and establishes requirements for agencies to remediate any such vulnerabilities included in the catalog. CISA will determine vulnerabilities warranting inclusion in the catalog based on reliable evidence that the exploit is being actively used to exploit public or private organizations by a threat actor. In consultation with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and DHS CISA, FedRAMP emphasizes that Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) who maintain federal information fall within the scope defined by <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities">Binding Operational Directive 22-01</a>. Therefore, <strong>all CSPs must review and implement the actions described within the Binding Operational Directive</strong>. To address the requirement, FedRAMP has updated the POA&M template to accommodate tracking of vulnerabilities against the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities</a>; or, CSPs can simply add a column (column AB, with the header ‘Binding Operational Directive 22-01 tracking’) in their current POA&M. This new column should be filled out with a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ as to whether this POA&M item’s vulnerability is found in the catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities. We strongly suggest that you sign up for automatic alerts when new vulnerabilities are added to the catalog. If any indication of compromise or anomalous behavior is found or there is any suspected impact to federal systems, please make sure to follow the FedRAMP Incident Communication Procedures, which includes reporting to CISA US-CERT and AOs. </p>

As stated by CISA in the Emergency Directive, this determination is based on the likelihood of the vulnerabilities being weaponized, combined with the widespread use of the affected software across the Executive Branch and high potential for a compromise of integrity and confidentiality of agency information.</p>

            <p>In consultation with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and DHS CISA, FedRAMP is directing Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to review the risks and actions outlined in <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-20-02-mitigate-windows-vulnerabilities-january-2020-patch-tuesday">Emergency Directive 20-02</a>.</p>

            <p>In accordance with FedRAMP continuous monitoring requirements, we request that you review and patch all affected endpoints (Action 1) within your FedRAMP authorized boundary, according to the timelines described within the Emergency Directive. Additionally, please provide an initial status report to the FedRAMP PMO (<a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>), AOs by Friday, January 17 (5:00pm EST). Initial status reports must include a response to the following fields: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Total number of affected endpoints within your FedRAMP authorized boundary</li>
              <li>Number of affected endpoints within your FedRAMP authorized boundary that have been patched to date</li>
              <li>If necessary, identified constraints, support needs, and observed challenges</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Follow Up Communications</h5>
            <p>Please provide a completion report to the FedRAMP PMO (<a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>) and AOs by Wednesday, January 29 (5:00pm EST). Completion reports must include a response to the following fields: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Total number of affected endpoints within your FedRAMP authorized boundary</li>
              <li>Number of affected endpoints within your FedRAMP authorized boundary that have been patched to date</li>
              <li>Detail any management controls implemented to ensure all newly provisioned and previously disconnected endpoints have been patched before they are connected to production environments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When corresponding to the FedRAMP PMO via <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a> with questions or when submitting the requested data, please include “Emergency Directive 20-02” in the email subject line. </p>

            <h5>Initial Communications</h5>		  
            <p>On January 22, 2019, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued Emergency Directive (ED) 19-01: Mitigate DNS Infrastructure Tampering. This directive was issued to address significant risks to federal information systems based on observed activity related to the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2019/01/10/dns-infrastructure-hijacking-campaign">Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure tampering campaign</a>.</p>
            
            <h5>What is the role of FedRAMP and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)?</h5>
           
           <p>While agency DNS records may point to services hosted by CSPs, the domain and domain records ownership and management is still a responsibility of individual federal agencies. The Emergency Directive targets the naming mechanism of DNS and not the connection to/content at a service provider.</p>
            
           <p>FedRAMP and DHS CISA considers CSPs out of scope of ED 19-01, as it is specific to agency-owned and agency-managed DNS accounts. Please direct any further questions to DHS (<a href="mailto:cyberliaison@hq.dhs.gov">cyberliaison@hq.dhs.gov</a>) on this matter. </p>
            
           <p>For more details and examples, please see the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-19-01-mitigate-dns-infrastructure-tampering">ED 19-01 FAQ</a>. </p>
