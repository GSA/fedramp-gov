            <p>On May 18, 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-22-03-mitigate-vmware-vulnerabilities">Emergency Directive 22-03</a>, “Mitigate VMware Vulnerabilities” (the Emergency Directive). The Emergency Directive states the following:</p>

            <p>Threat actors, including likely advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, are exploiting vulnerabilities (CVE 2022-22954 and CVE 2022-22960) in the following VMWare products: VMware Workspace ONE Access (Access), VMware Identity Manager (vIDM), VMware vRealize Automation (vRA), VMware Cloud Foundation, vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager (impacted VMware products). VMware released an update to address these vulnerabilities on April 6, 2022, and threat actors were able to reverse engineer the update and begin exploitation of impacted VMware products that remained unpatched within 48 hours of the update’s release. </p>

            <p>On May 18, 2022, VMware released an update for two new vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-22972 and CVE-2022-22973). Based on the above, CISA expects threat actors to quickly develop a capability to exploit these newly released vulnerabilities in the same impacted VMware products. Exploiting the above vulnerabilities permits attackers to trigger a server-side template injection that may result in remote code execution (CVE-2022-22954); escalate privileges to 'root' (CVE-2022-22960 and CVE-2022-22973); and obtain administrative access without the need to authenticate (CVE-2022- 22972).</p> 

            <p>As defined by <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities">Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01</a>, CVE 2022-22954 and CVE 2022-22960 were added to CISA’s catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs) on April 14 and April 15, 2022, respectively and updates were required to be applied by May 5, 2022. CISA will continue to monitor for exploitation and will add KEVs to the BOD 22-01 catalog as needed. </p>

The Directive establishes a CISA-managed <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities</a> that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise and establishes requirements for agencies to remediate any such vulnerabilities included in the catalog. CISA will determine vulnerabilities warranting inclusion in the catalog based on reliable evidence that the exploit is being actively used to exploit public or private organizations by a threat actor. In consultation with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and DHS CISA, FedRAMP emphasizes that Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) who maintain federal information fall within the scope defined by <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities">Binding Operational Directive 22-01</a>. Therefore, <strong>all CSPs must review and implement the actions described within the Binding Operational Directive</strong>. To address the requirement, FedRAMP has updated the POA&M template to accommodate tracking of vulnerabilities against the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities</a>; or, CSPs can simply add a column (column AB, with the header ‘Binding Operational Directive 22-01 tracking’) in their current POA&M. This new column should be filled out with a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ as to whether this POA&M item’s vulnerability is found in the catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities. We strongly suggest that you sign up for automatic alerts when new vulnerabilities are added to the catalog. If any indication of compromise or anomalous behavior is found or there is any suspected impact to federal systems, please make sure to follow the FedRAMP Incident Communication Procedures, which includes reporting to CISA US-CERT and AOs. </p>

            <h5>Initial Communications</h5>		  
            <p>On January 14, 2020, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-20-02-mitigate-windows-vulnerabilities-january-2020-patch-tuesday">Emergency Directive 20-02</a>, “Mitigate Windows Vulnerabilities from January 2020 Patch Tuesday”. The Emergency Directive addresses multiple vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows operating systems that, based on CISA’s determination, pose an unacceptable risk to the Federal enterprise and require an immediate and emergency action. As stated by CISA in the Emergency Directive, this determination is based on the likelihood of the vulnerabilities being weaponized, combined with the widespread use of the affected software across the Executive Branch and high potential for a compromise of integrity and confidentiality of agency information.</p>

            <p>In consultation with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and DHS CISA, FedRAMP is directing Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to review the risks and actions outlined in <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-20-02-mitigate-windows-vulnerabilities-january-2020-patch-tuesday">Emergency Directive 20-02</a>.</p>

            <p>In accordance with FedRAMP continuous monitoring requirements, we request that you review and patch all affected endpoints (Action 1) within your FedRAMP authorized boundary, according to the timelines described within the Emergency Directive. Additionally, please provide an initial status report to the FedRAMP PMO (<a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>), AOs by Friday, January 17 (5:00pm EST). Initial status reports must include a response to the following fields: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Total number of affected endpoints within your FedRAMP authorized boundary</li>
              <li>Number of affected endpoints within your FedRAMP authorized boundary that have been patched to date</li>
              <li>If necessary, identified constraints, support needs, and observed challenges</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Follow Up Communications</h5>
            <p>Please provide a completion report to the FedRAMP PMO (<a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>) and AOs by Wednesday, January 29 (5:00pm EST). Completion reports must include a response to the following fields: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Total number of affected endpoints within your FedRAMP authorized boundary</li>
              <li>Number of affected endpoints within your FedRAMP authorized boundary that have been patched to date</li>
              <li>Detail any management controls implemented to ensure all newly provisioned and previously disconnected endpoints have been patched before they are connected to production environments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When corresponding to the FedRAMP PMO via <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a> with questions or when submitting the requested data, please include “Emergency Directive 20-02” in the email subject line. </p>

            <p>On January 22, 2019, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued Emergency Directive (ED) 19-01: Mitigate DNS Infrastructure Tampering. This directive was issued to address significant risks to federal information systems based on observed activity related to the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2019/01/10/dns-infrastructure-hijacking-campaign">Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure tampering campaign</a>.</p>
            
            <h5>What is the role of FedRAMP and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)?</h5>
           
           <p>While agency DNS records may point to services hosted by CSPs, the domain and domain records ownership and management is still a responsibility of individual federal agencies. The Emergency Directive targets the naming mechanism of DNS and not the connection to/content at a service provider.</p>
            
           <p>FedRAMP and DHS CISA considers CSPs out of scope of ED 19-01, as it is specific to agency-owned and agency-managed DNS accounts. Please direct any further questions to DHS (<a href="mailto:cyberliaison@hq.dhs.gov">cyberliaison@hq.dhs.gov</a>) on this matter. </p>
            
           <p>For more details and examples, please see the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-19-01-mitigate-dns-infrastructure-tampering">ED 19-01 FAQ</a>. </p>
