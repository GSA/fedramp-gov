				<p>The first step for any Cloud Service Provider (CSP) interested in pursuing a FedRAMP authorization for their Cloud Service Offering (CSO) is to determine their authorization strategy. There are two paths a CSP can pursue to achieve a FedRAMP authorization&#58; a Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) from the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and an Agency Authority to Operate (ATO).</p>

			<div class="full-col desktop:grid-col-6">
				<h3>Pursuing a JAB P-ATO Authorization</h3>
				<p>The JAB is the primary governing body for FedRAMP and includes representatives from the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and General Services Administration (GSA). More information on the authority, objectives, roles and responsibilities, and establishment of the JAB can be found in the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Joint_Authorization_Board_Charter.pdf" target="_blank">JAB Charter</a>.</p> 

				<p>Below is a high-level overview of the JAB Authorization Process. The document <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_JAB_P-ATO_Roles_and_Responsibilites.pdf" target="_blank">JAB P-ATO CSP Roles &amp; Responsibilities</a> provides further detail on the JAB P-ATO authorization process.</p>

			<div class="full-col desktop:grid-col-9">
				<p>The JAB invests heavily into creating a <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products">broad marketplace</a> of CSOs and, based on current resources and funding, has the capacity to authorize a limited number of CSOs each year. To ensure the JAB’s resources are used most effectively, the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO)and JAB evaluate CSOs through FedRAMP Connect.</p>
				
				<h4>FedRAMP Connect</h4>
				
				<p>FedRAMP Connect is the process by which CSPs are evaluated based on the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_JAB_P-ATO_Prioritization_Criteria_and_Guidance.pdf">JAB Prioritization Criteria</a> and prioritized to work with the JAB. The only mandatory prioritization criteria for CSPs is demonstrated demand for their service by a wide variety of federal agencies.</p>

				<p>CSPs interested in working with the JAB are required to review the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_JAB_P-ATO_Prioritization_Criteria_and_Guidance.pdf">JAB Prioritization Criteria and Guidance document</a> and follow the instructions on how to submit a Business Case to info@fedramp.gov. The FedRAMP PMO collects Business Cases on an on-going basis and has cut off dates for each round of prioritization when all Business Cases will be reviewed together. The next Business Case due date will be in Fall/Winter 2020. </p>

				<p>After a CSP is prioritized, it has 60 days to become FedRAMP Ready to JAB standards (if it isn’t already). Being prioritized to work with the JAB and being deemed FedRAMP Ready constitute the first phase of the JAB Authorization Process.</p>

				
				<h4>FedRAMP Ready</h4>
				
				<p>To achieve the FedRAMP Ready designation, a CSP must work with an accredited 3PAO to complete a readiness assessment of its service offering. At the conclusion of the assessment, the 3PAO delivers a <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Moderate-RAR-Template.docx" target="_blank">Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)</a> attesting to the CSO’s readiness for the authorization process. The RAR documents the CSP’s capability to meet FedRAMP and the JAB’s security requirements and is intended to help the JAB have a snapshot of the security posture of a cloud service without the full investment of going through the entire FedRAMP assessment process of testing and documentation.</p>

				<p>RARs are reviewed by the FedRAMP PMO within one to two weeks of submission. Once the RAR is deemed satisfactory by the PMO, the CSO will be designated FedRAMP Ready and advertised in the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products">FedRAMP Marketplace</a>.</p>
