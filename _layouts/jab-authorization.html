				<p><strong>The JAB is the primary governing body for FedRAMP and includes representatives from the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and General Services Administration (GSA).</strong></p>

				<p>The JAB selects approximately 12 cloud products a year to work with for a JAB Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO). Additionally, the JAB is responsible for performing the continuous monitoring for all JAB authorized cloud products. Below is a high-level overview of the JAB Provisional Authorization Process.

					<p>If the JAB path is the selected authorization process, the first major phase is preparation. There are two steps within this phase: FedRAMP Connect and the readiness assessment, which is required unlike in the agency process. As a part of the FedRAMP connect step a CSP must submit the FedRAMP connect business case and then become prioritized to work with JAB. After this the CSP begins the readiness assessment step, beginning with securing an RAR development which is then reviewed by the FedRAMP PMO. Remediation will take place if needed followed by the issuing of the FedRAMP ready designation. </p>

					<p>Once the CSP is prioritized for JAB and FedRAMP ready they may begin the authorization phase. The first step involves securing a full security authorization package which includes deliverables such as the SSP, SAP, SAR, and POA&M. After this starts the next step, the JAB authorization process. After a kick-off meeting servicing as a review for the offering is held, periods of time dedicated to remediation, review, and a final review take place. After all of this is complete, the JAB will issue the CSP a P-ATO letter in coordination with becoming FedRAMP authorized. </p>

				<p>The JAB prioritizes approximately 12 CSOs each year. The JAB evaluates CSOs through a process called <strong>FedRAMP Connect</strong>.</p>

				<p><strong>FedRAMP Connect</strong> is the process by which CSPs are evaluated based on the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_JAB_P-ATO_Prioritization_Criteria_and_Guidance.pdf" target="_blank">JAB Prioritization Criteria</a> and prioritized to work with the JAB. CSPs interested in working with the JAB are required to review the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_JAB_P-ATO_Prioritization_Criteria_and_Guidance.pdf" target="_blank">JAB Prioritization Criteria and Guidance document</a>, complete the FedRAMP  Business Case and send it to <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>. CSOs are selected during specific time frames through-out the year, which is announced on <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/blog/">FedRAMP Blog</a>. </p>

				<h3 class="margin-top-0">Readiness Assessment</h3>
 
				<p>In order to kick-off with the JAB, CSPs must achieve the “FedRAMP Ready” JAB designation for their CSO. If the JAB selects a CSO that has not yet achieved FedRAMP Ready status, the CSP has 60 days to become FedRAMP Ready to JAB standards. </p>

				<p>To achieve the <strong>FedRAMP Ready</strong> designation, a CSP must work with an accredited 3PAO to complete a Readiness Assessment of its service offering. The Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) documents the CSP's capability to meet FedRAMP’s JAB security requirements. RARs provide the JAB with a snapshot of a cloud service's security posture without requiring CSPs to make the full investment of going through the entire FedRAMP assessment process of testing and documentation. The FedRAMP PMO reviews each RAR to ensure a CSO’s core security capabilities and operational processes are in place. More information regarding steps to achieve <strong>FedRAMP Ready</strong> can be found in the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Marketplace_Designations_for_Cloud_Service_Providers.pdf" target="_blank">FedRAMP Marketplace Designations for Cloud Service Providers document</a>.</p>

				<p>During this step, after a CSO is both prioritized to work with the JAB and deemed FedRAMP Ready:</p>
				<ul class="red-bullets">
					<li>The CSP finalizes the System Security Plan (SSP) and engages an accredited 3PAO.</li>

					<li>The CSP develops a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to track and manage system security risks identified in the SAR.</li>
				
				</ul>

				<p>The SSP, SAP, SAR, POA&M, and one month of continuous monitoring deliverables must be completed using FedRAMP-provided templates and should be submitted together. The JAB must have a CSP’s full security package for a minimum of two weeks prior to kicking off with the JAB.</p>

				<h3 class="margin-top-0">JAB Authorization Process</h3>

				<p>The JAB Authorization Process uses an agile methodology with multiple stage gates and the “fail fast” principle. The first stage gate is JAB Kick-Off. During this step, the CSP, 3PAO, and FedRAMP collaboratively review the CSO’s system architecture, security capabilities, and risk posture. Based on the outcome of the kickoff meeting, the JAB will issue a “go” or “no-go” decision to proceed with the authorization. </p>

				<p>Following the kick off, the JAB conducts an in-depth review of the security authorization package. The CSP and 3PAO are expected to support JAB reviewers by addressing questions and comments in a timely manner and participating in regular meetings. Monthly continuous monitoring deliverables (scan files, POA&M, and up-to-date inventory) are required to be prepared and submitted to the JAB through-out the JAB authorization process.</p>

				<p>Once the JAB’s review is complete, the CSP and 3PAO remediate outstanding issues. Once completed, the JAB will issue  a formal authorization decision and if favorable, issue a provisional authorization to operate (P-ATO).</p>
				
				<p>Note: A JAB P-ATO is not a risk acceptance, but an assurance to agencies that the risk posture of the system has been reviewed and approved by DoD, DHS, and GSA. Each agency planning to use the CSO must then review and issue its own ATO, which covers the agency’s use of the cloud service.</p>

				<p>During the continuous monitoring phase, a CSP must continue to provide monthly continuous monitoring deliverables, to include incident reporting, to the JAB and agencies that are using their service. While each agency’s Authorizing Official (AO) maintains the final approval authority for the use of a system by that agency, the JAB acts as a focal point for continuous monitoring activities of systems with a P-ATO. The JAB:</p>
				<ul class="red-bullets">
					<li>Reviews continuous monitoring and security artifacts on a regular basis;</li>
					<li>Authorizes, denies, monitors, suspends, and revokes a system’s P-ATO as appropriate;</li>
					<li>Authorizes or denies significant change and deviation requests; and</li>
					<li>Ensures the FedRAMP PMO is providing artifacts to leveraging agencies in a timely manner.</li>
				</ul>
