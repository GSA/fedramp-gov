					<h2>FedRAMP Authorization&#58; A CSP’s Perspective</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="full-col desktop:grid-col-6 intro-text">
					<p>CSPs whose services are currently being used by the federal government or are interested in working with the  federal government should obtain a FedRAMP authorization as required in the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf">OMB memorandum</a>. CSPs considering pursuing a FedRAMP Authorization should review the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Authorization_Playbook_Getting_Started_with_FedRAMP.pdf">CSP Authorization Playbook&#58; Getting Started with FedRAMP</a> which provides an overview of the partners involved in a FedRAMP authorization, things to consider when determining an authorization strategy, types of authorizations, and important considerations for a CSP’s offering when working with FedRAMP.</p>

								<h3>Pre-Authorization Best Practices</h3>
								<p>Once a CSP decides to pursue a FedRAMP Authorization, it is recommended that the CSP reviews  FedRAMP’s documents and templates found on the Policy &amp; Guidance page, along with other resources available on the FedRAMP website. In order to successfully navigate the Pre-Authorization phase, a CSP should&#58;</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Establish strong partnerships with agency customers and document agency interest in their offering becoming FedRAMP Authorized through RFIs, RFPs, and RFQs.</li>
									<li>Establish a partnership with a FedRAMP approved Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO). 3PAOs are listed in the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/">FedRAMP Marketplace</a>. </li>
									<li>Complete a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScU4_x5UK53d0PUUDsOdqWyzUvAN1-yFJ1NxffT7PkGkCiuPg/viewform">CSP Information Form</a>, which will prompt the FedRAMP PMO to set up a consultative intake call to discuss the system and the best authorization strategy for the CSP. During this call you will discuss your system and the best authorization strategy for you.</li>
									<li>Ensure that the service offering has implemented the necessary FedRAMP security controls in accordance with appropriate data impact levels as described in <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.199.pdf">FIPS PUB 199</a> (e.g. High, Moderate, Low, Low-Impact SaaS).</li>
									<li>Complete <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/training">FedRAMP Training, including the FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP) Required Documents (200-A)</a> module.</li>
								</ul>	

								<h3>JAB vs. Agency Authorization Path</h3>

								<p>There are two ways to achieve a FedRAMP Authorization - through the Join Authorization Board, JAB, or by partnering with an agency. Both paths require the same deliverables. The main difference between the JAB preliminary authorization and the agency authorization is the government entity that reviews these deliverables.</p>

								<p>Demand is a key consideration for CSPs deciding between pursuing a Joint Authorization Board (JAB)  Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO), Agency ATO, or both. FedRAMP generally evaluates Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs) as having broad or niche demand. Broad demand reflects proven or potential demand for an offering from multiple agencies, and niche demand reflects agency-specific utility or applicability of an offering. When evaluating which authorization to pursue, a CSP should be able to qualify whether their offering has broad or niche demand, as CSOs with broad demand are more appropriate for a JAB P-ATO and CSOs with niche demand are more appropriate for an Agency ATO.</p>

								<p>In order to pursue a JAB Authorization, CSPs must be prioritized to work with the JAB through the FedRAMP Connect process. The FedRAMP Connect process is outlined in the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_JAB_P-ATO_Prioritization_Criteria_and_Guidance.pdf">FedRAMP JAB P-ATO Prioritization Criteria and Guidance document</a>. In order to pursue an Agency Authorization, CSPs must identify an initial authorizing agency and meet FedRAMP’s requirements to become In Process. Guidelines on the requirements to be designated as FedRAMP In Process are detailed in the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Marketplace_Designations_for_Cloud_Service_Providers.pdf">FedRAMP Marketplace: Designations for Cloud Service Providers document</a>.</p>

								<h3>Package Development</h3>
								<p>This includes a Kick-Off meeting with representatives from the CSP, partnering agency, 3PAO, and FedRAMP PMO. The CSP then completes the System Security Plan (SSP) and attachments and the 3PAO develops the Security Assessment Plan (SAP). </p>
								
								<h4>Building the SSP</h4>
								<p>The SSP is the main document of a security package. A SSP provides a detailed narrative of a CSP’s security control implementation, a detailed system description including components and services inventory, and detailed depictions of the system’s data flows and authorization boundary. FedRAMP provides a SSP template for each of its baselines: Low, Moderate, and High.</p>

									
								<p>Agency AOs or designees are responsible for reviewing and approving the SSPs ensuring the appropriate level of detail and the implementation of controls is acceptable, both at time of assessment and during ConMon. Some agencies may require additional controls on top of the FedRAMP baselines.</p>
								<p>In addition to a completed SSP template, CSPs should complete and append the following materials to their security documentation&#58;</p>

								<h3>Testing and Assessment</h3>
								<p>The 3PAO completes testing and submits the Security Assessment Report (SAR). The CSP then creates the Plan of Action &amp; Milestones (POA&amp;M) based on the findings from testing.</p>
								<h4>After Assessment</h4>
								<p>The SAR contains the results of the comprehensive security assessment of a CSP’s cloud service offering, including a summary of the risks associated with vulnerabilities of the system identified during testing. The purpose of a SAR is to evaluate the system’s implementation of, and compliance with, the FedRAMP baseline security controls, and thus the system’s compliance with FISMA security mandates.</p>
								
								<p>A CSP’s 3PAO is responsible for generating the SAR following assessment and the document must align with the assessment methodology described in the Security Assessment Plan (SAP) and address the control detail described in the System Security Plan (SSP). An effective SAR should inform a CSP’s Plan of Action &amp; Milestones (POA&amp;M) and reflect the true risk posture of the system. After the SAR is delivered, the CSP, Agency, 3PAO, and FedRAMP PMO convene for a SAR debrief to discuss the CSP plan for remediation and next steps to Authorization.</p>
								
								<h4>Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M)</h4>
								<p>When the SAR is delivered, the CSP will create a ‘Plan of Actions and Milestones’, or POA&amp;M for each corresponding 3PAO finding. A POA&amp;M is the CSP’s plan for remediation of any remaining risk identified during assessment. The POA&amp;M:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>facilitates a disciplined and structured approach to tracking risk mitigation activities.</li>
									<li>includes security findings for the system from continuous monitoring activities and periodic security assessments, such as the Annual Assessment</li>
									<li>describes the current disposition of any discovered vulnerabilities and system findings, and includes a CSP’s intended corrective actions for those findings.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Agency AOs are responsible for reviewing and approving POA&amp;Ms, making their own risk-based decision both at the time of the initial assessment and during ConMon.</p>
								<p>FedRAMP uses the POA&amp;M to monitor the CSP’s progress in correcting these findings. A CSP applying for a JAB P-ATO or an Agency ATO, must establish and maintain a POA&amp;M for their system in accordance with the POA&amp;M Template Completion Guide using the FedRAMP POA&amp;M Template. The POA&amp;M includes the&#58;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Specific weaknesses or deficiencies in deployed security controls and the source of the identified weakness</li>
									<li>Severity of the identified security control weaknesses or deficiencies</li>
									<li>Scope or affected assets of the weakness in components within the environment</li>
									<li>Proposed risk mitigation approach to address the identified weaknesses or deficiencies in the security control implementations (e.g., prioritization of risk mitigation actions and allocation of risk mitigation resources)</li>
									<li>Status of any deviation request(s)</li>
								</ul>
								<h3 class="margin-top-4">Authorization</h3>
								<p>The authorizing party (either an agency or the JAB) reviews the security package and decides whether or not to accept the risk posture associated with the system. If accepted, the authorizing party grants an authorization for the CSP’s service offering (either an Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) or a JAB P-ATO). An ATO letter is submitted to the FedRAMP PMO.</p>

								<p class="text-center"><strong>Once a CSO has been authorized, it is listed in the FedRAMP Marketplace.</strong></p>
								<h3 class="margin-top-4">Continuous Monitoring <span style="text-transform: none;">(ConMon)</span></h3>
								<p>Once a FedRAMP authorization has been granted, the security posture of a CSO is monitored according to the assessment and authorization process. Performing ongoing security assessments determines whether the set of deployed security controls in a CSO remains effective in lieu of new exploits and attacks, as well as planned and unplanned changes that occur in the system environment over the life of the system. To maintain a FedRAMP authorization, the CSP must monitor their security control environment, assess that control environment on a regular basis, and demonstrate that the security posture of their service offering is continuously acceptable.</p>
									
								<p>Ongoing assessment of security controls results in greater control over the security posture of the CSO and enables timely risk-management decisions. Security-related information collected through continuous monitoring is used to make recurring updates to the system security package. CSPs and Agencies should define and agree to a monthly meeting cadence early in the Authorization process. </p>
								
								<h3 class="margin-top-4">Annual Assessment</h3>
								<p>Completing an annual assessment for a FedRAMP authorized CSO includes&#58;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Review and update, as required, of the System Security Plan (SSP) and attachments</li>
									<li>Completion of a Incident Response Plan Test and provision of the Incident Response Plan Test Report</li>
									<li>Completion of a Contingency Plan functional test and provision of the Contingency Plan Test Report</li>
									<li>Completion of the Annual Assessment Security Assessment Plan (SAP)</li>
									<li>Completion of Annual Assessment testing</li>
									<li>Completion of the Annual Assessment Security Assessment Report (SAR)</li>
									<li>Update of the CSOs Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M)</li>
									<li>Submission of the completed Annual Assessment package, including the SAR and attachments, updated SSP and attachments, updated SAP, and POA&amp;M to FedRAMP PMO or Agency AO</li>
								</ul>
								<p>CSPs are required to engage a 3PAO to complete Annual Assessment testing. All documentation that results from an Annual Assessment should be uploaded to the FedRAMP secure repository, OMB MAX, by the CSP’s ATO date. The Annual Assessment should be reviewed by their agency customer(s) Authorizing Official and approved before being uploaded to OMB MAX. Any updates to an offering’s Impact Level should be reported to the PMO, via <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>, before being uploaded to OMB MAX.</p>
