					<p>The federal government is one of the largest buyers of cloud technology, and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) offer agencies innovative products that help them save time and resources while meeting their critical mission needs. </p>

				<div class="partners-main-top-desktop">
					<p>CSPs who have a Cloud Service Offering (CSO) that is being used by the federal government should be thinking about obtaining a FedRAMP Authorization. FedRAMP provides a standardized security framework for all cloud products and services that is recognized by all executive branch federal agencies. CSPs only need to go through the FedRAMP authorization process once for each product and perform continuous monitoring; with all agencies reviewing the same continuous monitoring deliverables, creating efficiencies across the government. The FedRAMP PMO provides training, guidance, and advisory support to cloud service providers, helping them navigate the FedRAMP process and understand the requirements.</p>
