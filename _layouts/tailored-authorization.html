				<p>FedRAMP was originally built around enterprise-wide solutions that would cover the broadest range of data types for cloud architectures moving into the federal space. FedRAMP currently has three sets of baseline security requirements: <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, and <strong>High</strong> impact based on <a href="#">FIPS 199</a> categorization.</p>
				
				<p>The FedRAMP Tailored baseline provides a minimum set of security control requirements. As always and required by law, agency AOs have the ultimate responsibility of determining if additional security controls are required to remain in compliance with agency-specific policies, procedures, and their own risk tolerance. The FedRAMP program, including our goals for Tailored, is a key part of issuing an informed, risk-based Authority to Operate (ATO).</p>
