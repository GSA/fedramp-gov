					<h2 class="center">FedRAMP Authorization: An Assessor’s Perspective</h2>
					<div class="intro-text">
						<p>FedRAMP accredited Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) perform the initial and periodic assessments of cloud systems to ensure they meet FedRAMP security requirements as part of a Cloud Service Provider’s (CSPs) FedRAMP authorization.</p>
						<p>3PAOs play a critical role in the authorization process by assessing the security of a cloud service. 3PAOs perform both initial and annual assessments of a cloud service offering to ensure security standards continually meet FedRAMP requirements. 3PAOs may also provide consultation to a CSP as they develop their system or documentation related to a FedRAMP authorization. However, a 3PAO that provides consulting services to a CSP may not complete the assessment for that CSP’s service as part of the authorization process.</p>

								<h3>Planning for an Initial Authorization</h3>
								<p>3PAO works with the CSP to develop a project plan for FedRAMP authorization. It is recommended that 3PAOs and their CSP engage the FedRAMP PMO early and often when beginning an authorization to ask questions and receive guidance on their strategy.</p>
								<p>3PAOs are also responsible for executing a Readiness Assessment testing when a CSP is pursuing a FedRAMP Ready designation. The Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) that the 3PAO produces will assess a CSP’s system’s operational security capabilities. The FedRAMP PMO reviews all RARs and if satisfactory, the CSP system will be designated “FedRAMP Ready.” This designation indicates that a 3PAO attests to a CSO’s readiness for the authorization process. The <a href="#">3PAO Readiness Assessment Report Guide</a> provides 3PAOs with best practices to successfully complete a high quality RAR.</p>

								<h3>Conducting Assessments </h3>
								<h4>1) Completing a Security Assessment Plan (SAP)</h4>
								
								<p>The SAP contains the test plan to assess the security controls of a system. The test plan functions as a detailed roadmap of the approach and methodology for the assessment of a CSP’s cloud service. The SAP includes&#58;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Penetration Test Plan - aligned to FedRAMP’s Penetration Test Guidance</li>
									<li>Inventory Worksheet that coincides with the inventory provided in the SSP.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The SAP also serves as a Rules of Engagement, once signed by the CSP and 3PAO, as it includes all applicable rules of engagement for the assessment. The joint responsibility of the CSP and the 3PAO, the SAP is a customized account of the security assessment methodology and indicates that both the CSP and 3PAO are in full concurrence as to the scope of security assessment testing. Authorizing Officials (AOs) are responsible for reviewing and approving the SAPs at both the time of the assessment and during ConMon.</p>
								<p>A completed SAP includes the following documentation&#58;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>FedRAMP Security Assessment Plan</li>
									<li>FedRAMP Security Test Case Workbook</li>
									<li>Penetration Testing Plan and Methodology</li>
									<li>3PAO Supplied Deliverables</li>
									<li>Penetration Test Rules of Engagement</li>
									<li>Sampling Methodology</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>2) Performing initial and periodic assessments of the service’s security controls</h4>
								<h4>3) Producing a Security Assessment Report (SAR)</h4>
								<p>The SAR contains the results of the comprehensive security assessment of a CSP’s cloud service offering, including a summary of the risks associated with vulnerabilities of the system identified during testing. The purpose of a SAR is to evaluate the system’s implementation of, and compliance with, the FedRAMP baseline security controls, and thus the system’s compliance with FISMA security mandates.</p>
								<p>A 3PAO is responsible for generating the SAR following assessment and the document must align with the assessment methodology described in the SAP and address the control detail described in the SSP. An effective SAR should inform a CSP’s Plan of Action &amp; Milestones (POA&amp;M) and reflect the true risk posture of the system.</p>
								<p>Like SSPs, agency AOs or designees are responsible for reviewing and approving the SARs ensuring the appropriate level of testing was done and that the risk posture associated with the system is acceptable to that agency, both at time of assessment and during ConMon.
								In addition to a completed SAR template, 3PAOs should complete and append the following materials to their assessment report.</p>

								<p class="text-center"><strong>Once a CSO has been authorized, it is listed in the FedRAMP Marketplace.</strong></p>
								<h3 class="margin-top-4">Continuous Monitoring <span style="text-transform: none;">(ConMon)</span></h3>
								<p>Once a FedRAMP authorization has been granted, the security posture of a CSO is monitored according to the assessment and authorization process. Performing ongoing security assessments determines whether the set of deployed security controls in a CSO remains effective in lieu of new exploits and attacks, as well as planned and unplanned changes that occur in the system environment over the life of the system. To maintain a FedRAMP authorization, the CSP must monitor their security control environment, assess that control environment on a regular basis, and demonstrate that the security posture of their service offering is continuously acceptable.</p>
									
								<p>Ongoing assessment of security controls results in greater control over the security posture of the CSO and enables timely risk-management decisions. Security-related information collected through continuous monitoring is used to make recurring updates to the system security package. CSPs and Agencies should define and agree to a monthly meeting cadence early in the Authorization process. </p>
								
								<h3 class="margin-top-4">Annual Assessment</h3>
								<p>Completing an annual assessment for a FedRAMP authorized CSO includes&#58;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Review and update, as required, of the System Security Plan (SSP) and attachments</li>
									<li>Completion of a Incident Response Plan Test and provision of the Incident Response Plan Test Report</li>
									<li>Completion of a Contingency Plan functional test and provision of the Contingency Plan Test Report</li>
									<li>Completion of the Annual Assessment Security Assessment Plan (SAP)</li>
									<li>Completion of Annual Assessment testing</li>
									<li>Completion of the Annual Assessment Security Assessment Report (SAR)</li>
									<li>Update of the CSOs Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M)</li>
									<li>Submission of the completed Annual Assessment package, including the SAR and attachments, updated SSP and attachments, updated SAP, and POA&amp;M to FedRAMP PMO or Agency AO</li>
								</ul>
								<p>CSPs are required to engage a 3PAO to complete Annual Assessment testing. All documentation that results from an Annual Assessment should be uploaded to the FedRAMP secure repository, OMB MAX, by the CSP’s ATO date. The Annual Assessment should be reviewed by their agency customer(s) Authorizing Official and approved before being uploaded to OMB MAX. Any updates to an offering’s Impact Level should be reported to the PMO, via <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>, before being uploaded to OMB MAX.</p>

				<h3>Continuous Monitoring</h3>
				<p>After an authorization has been granted, the cloud service enters continuous monitoring. 3PAOs perform annual testing as required by the CSP and the authorizing party. CSPs can also engage 3PAOs during the continuous monitoring phase to validate Deviation Requests, Significant Changes, and participate in or fully perform monthly assessments.</p>
