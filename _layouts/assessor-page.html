						<p>FedRAMP recognized Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) play a critical role in independently assessing the effectiveness of security controls associated with cloud service offerings (CSOs). 3PAO assessments serve as the basis from which the federal government makes informed, risk-based authorization decisions for the government use of cloud products and services.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="full-col desktop:grid-col-6">
					<p>Assessment quality is expected across the government, regardless of whether a 3PAO is working directly with the Joint Authorization Board (JAB), FedRAMP PMO, or an agency. These expectations are outlined in the FedRAMP 3PAO Obligations and Performance Standards document.</p>
					
					<p>During FedRAMP assessments, 3PAOs produce a Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) or a complete security authorization package that is submitted for authorization to a government Authorizing Official (AO). 3PAOs may also provide consultation to a CSP as they develop their system or documentation related to a FedRAMP Authorization. However, a 3PAO, that provides consulting services to a CSP, may not complete the assessment for that CSP’s service as part of the authorization process. </p>

								<h3>Planning for an Initial Authorization</h3>

								<p>3PAOs work with CSPs to develop a project plan for a FedRAMP Authorization. It is recommended that 3PAOs and their CSP engage the FedRAMP PMO, early and often, when beginning an authorization to ask questions and receive guidance on their strategy. </p>

								<p>3PAOs are responsible for executing Readiness Assessment testing when a CSP is pursuing a FedRAMP Ready designation. The RAR, that the 3PAO produces, must&#58;</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Assess a CSO’s operational security capabilities</li>
									<li>Follow all requirements in accordance with the FedRAMP High RAR Template or FedRAMP Moderate RAR Template</li>
									<li>Include a clear attestation that is logical and aligns with the proposed residual risk of operating the system - without any conditional or ambiguous attestations</li>
								</ul>

								<p>The 3PAO must notify FedRAMP, at least two weeks prior to submission of a RAR, via <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a> and engage in additional steps with the FedRAMP PMO throughout the readiness assessment process. The FedRAMP PMO reviews all RARs and, if satisfactory, the CSP system will be designated “FedRAMP Ready.” This designation indicates that a 3PAO attests to a CSO’s readiness for the authorization process. The <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/3PAO_Readiness_Assessment_Report_Guide.pdf">3PAO Readiness Assessment Report Guide</a> provides 3PAOs with best practices to successfully complete a high quality RAR.</p>

								<h3>Conducting Assessments</h3>

								<h4>1)	Completing a Security Assessment Plan (SAP)</h4>

								<p>The SAP contains the test plan to assess the security controls of a system. The test plan functions as a detailed roadmap of the approach and methodology for the assessment of a CSP’s cloud service. The SAP includes the following&#58;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Penetration Test Plan that is aligned to FedRAMP’s Penetration Test Guidance</li>
									<li>Inventory Worksheet that coincides with the inventory provided in the SSP</li>
								</ul>

The SAP also serves as a rules of engagement, once signed by the CSP and 3PAO, as it includes all applicable rules of engagement for the assessment. It also provides a customized account of the security assessment methodology and indicates that both the CSP and 3PAO are in full concurrence of the security assessment testing scope. AOs are responsible for reviewing and approving the SAP at both the time of the assessment and during continuous monitoring (ConMon), including the:
●	FedRAMP Security Test Case Workbook
●	Penetration Testing Plan and Methodology
●	3PAO Supplied Deliverables
●	Penetration Test Rules of Engagement
●	Sampling Methodology
2)	Producing a Security Assessment Report (SAR)

The SAR contains the results of the CSO’s comprehensive security assessment, including a summary of the risks associated with the vulnerabilities of the system identified during testing.
The purpose of a SAR is to evaluate the system’s implementation of, and compliance with, the FedRAMP baseline of security controls, and thus the system’s compliance with FISMA security mandates.
Following the assessment, a 3PAO is responsible for generating the SAR. The document must align with the assessment methodology described in the SAP and address the control detail described in the SSP. An effective SAR should inform a CSP’s Plan of Actions & Milestones (POA&M) and reflect the true risk posture of the system. The 3PAO must provide a clear, independent authorization recommendation that is logical and aligns with the residual risk for operating the system - without any conditional or ambiguous attestations.
Agency AOs or designees are responsible for reviewing and approving the SAR. They should ensure the appropriate level of testing was done and that the risk posture associated with the system is acceptable to that agency, both at time of assessment and during ConMon.
In addition to a completed SAR template, 3PAOs should complete and append the following materials to their assessment report:
●	Risk Exposure Table
●	FedRAMP Security Test Case Workbook
●	Infrastructure Scan Results
●	Database Scan Results
●	Web Application Scan Results
●	Assessment Results
●	Manual Test Results
●	Documentation Review Findings
●	SAR Auxiliary Documents
●	Penetration Test Report
An assessor’s completed SAP and SAR is submitted, with the CSP’s System Security Plan (SSP), to form the authorization package. The package is ultimately reviewed and approved by the authorizing agency.

								<p class="text-center"><strong>Once a CSO has been authorized, it is listed in the FedRAMP Marketplace.</strong></p>
								<h3 class="margin-top-4">Continuous Monitoring <span style="text-transform: none;">(ConMon)</span></h3>
								<p>Once a FedRAMP authorization has been granted, the security posture of a CSO is monitored according to the assessment and authorization process. Performing ongoing security assessments determines whether the set of deployed security controls in a CSO remains effective in lieu of new exploits and attacks, as well as planned and unplanned changes that occur in the system environment over the life of the system. To maintain a FedRAMP authorization, the CSP must monitor their security control environment, assess that control environment on a regular basis, and demonstrate that the security posture of their service offering is continuously acceptable.</p>
									
								<p>Ongoing assessment of security controls results in greater control over the security posture of the CSO and enables timely risk-management decisions. Security-related information collected through continuous monitoring is used to make recurring updates to the system security package. CSPs and Agencies should define and agree to a monthly meeting cadence early in the Authorization process. </p>
								
								<h3 class="margin-top-4">Annual Assessment</h3>
								<p>Completing an annual assessment for a FedRAMP authorized CSO includes&#58;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Review and update, as required, of the System Security Plan (SSP) and attachments</li>
									<li>Completion of a Incident Response Plan Test and provision of the Incident Response Plan Test Report</li>
									<li>Completion of a Contingency Plan functional test and provision of the Contingency Plan Test Report</li>
									<li>Completion of the Annual Assessment Security Assessment Plan (SAP)</li>
									<li>Completion of Annual Assessment testing</li>
									<li>Completion of the Annual Assessment Security Assessment Report (SAR)</li>
									<li>Update of the CSOs Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M)</li>
									<li>Submission of the completed Annual Assessment package, including the SAR and attachments, updated SSP and attachments, updated SAP, and POA&amp;M to FedRAMP PMO or Agency AO</li>
								</ul>
								<p>CSPs are required to engage a 3PAO to complete Annual Assessment testing. All documentation that results from an Annual Assessment should be uploaded to the FedRAMP secure repository, OMB MAX, by the CSP’s ATO date. The Annual Assessment should be reviewed by their agency customer(s) Authorizing Official and approved before being uploaded to OMB MAX. Any updates to an offering’s Impact Level should be reported to the PMO, via <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>, before being uploaded to OMB MAX.</p>

								<h4>How to Become a FedRAMP Recognized 3PAO</h4>
								<p>In order to become a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO, A2LA must perform an initial assessment of the 3PAO and provide an initial assessment recommendation to FedRAMP for approval. In order for a 3PAO to maintain its FedRAMP recognition, A2LA must perform a favorable annual review (desk audit) and a full reassessment (on-site audit) every two years. A2LA assessments ensure 3PAOs meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 17020 (as revised) and FedRAMP-specific knowledge requirements.</p>

								<p>More information on becoming a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO can be found on the A2LA website.</p>
