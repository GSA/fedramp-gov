					<p>Making FedRAMP better is a team effort! As we modernize, we have to engage and innovate with stakeholders. To help us grow and scale the program, we are inviting cloud service providers, federal agencies, and other interested stakeholders to apply to participate in our new pilot program. Our aim is to use learnings from these pilots to refine our approach, improve processes, and explore new ways to deliver modern, secure cloud services across government. FedRAMP’s pilots will focus on innovations that benefit participants and the program as a whole, from improving the experience of cloud service providers considering FedRAMP, to making it easier for agencies to leverage market products in a secure way. </p>
