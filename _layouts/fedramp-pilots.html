						<p>Our aim with these pilots is to refine our approach, improve processes, and explore new ways to deliver modern, secure cloud services across government. FedRAMP’s pilots will focus on innovations that benefit participants and the program as a whole—from improving the experience of cloud service providers considering FedRAMP, to making it easier for agencies to leverage market products in a secure way. Pilots will explore a hypothesis and will involve a data-informed approach to evaluating outcomes before transitioning to practical adoption.</p>
						<p>As a pilot participant, you will have the opportunity to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>collaborate on projects that work to design, refine, and deliver a more streamlined approach to security and FedRAMP processes.</li>
							<li>identify ways to reduce the costs of getting, staying authorized, or reusing authorizations</li>
							<li>improve the experience of agencies and cloud service providers reuse of offerings</li>
							<li>explore and showcase innovative cybersecurity approaches</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Participants' varying expertise and points of view will be vital in improving the accessibility of the market to cloud service providers and making sure agencies have the most up-to-date technology to help government work better for everyone.</p>
						<p>We invite stakeholders to explore current pilot opportunities. Email us at pilots@fedramp.gov if you are interested in signing up or learning more about the FedRAMP pilot program.</p>
