            <p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that promotes the adoption of secure cloud services across the federal government by providing a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP empowers agencies to use modern cloud technologies, with emphasis on security and protection of federal information.</p>

            <p>FedRAMP eliminates duplicative efforts by providing a common security framework. Agencies review their security requirements against a standardized baseline.

            <p>TIC modernization aligned with OMB M-19-26 provides flexibility for TIC capabilities and architectures supporting cloud implementations. Generally, TIC controls are aligned with NIST SP 800-53 and should be aligned and evaluated to support the appropriate FedRAMP security control baselines. Determining the applicable and appropriate controls is a responsibility of both CSPs and agencies to establish a solution architecture that supports TIC policy enforcement points and other protections described in the TIC 3.0 Reference Architecture and TIC 3.0 Security Capabilities Catalog.</p>

          <div id="gen-security-controls" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
            <p>There is a shared security responsibility model when using cloud products. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Agencies (customers) both assume important security roles and responsibilities to ensure data is protected within cloud environments. CSPs are required to submit a Control Implementation Summary (CIS) workbook as an attachment to the System Secruity Plan (SSP). The CIS workbook identifies security controls that the CSP is responsible for implementing, security controls that the Agency (customer) is responsible for implementing, security controls where there is a shared CSP/Agency responsibility, and security controls that are inherited from an underlying FedRAMP Authorized Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)/Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). The CIS workbook also includes a Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) worksheet tab. CSPs must use the CRM to describe the specific elements of each control where the responsibility lies with the customer. Further details are also provided within the CSP’s SSP.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-0">FedRAMP provides two CIS Workbook templates: one for Low and Moderate systems and one for High systems. Both are available on  FedRAMP.gov’s <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/documents-templates/" >Documents &amp; Templates</a> page.</p>

            <p>If a Cloud Service Offering (CSO) is listed as <strong>FedRAMP Authorized</strong> on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/products" target="_blank">FedRAMP Marketplace</a>, it has successfully completed the FedRAMP Authorization process with the JAB or a federal agency. The <strong>FedRAMP Authorized</strong> designation indicates FedRAMP requirements are being met and a CSO’s security package is available for agency reuse. This means that any agency can request access to the security package for a FedRAMP Authorized CSO, review the security package, and issue their own Authority to Operate (ATO) for the product.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-0">When reusing FedRAMP security packages, agencies should complete and sign the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Package_Request_Form.pdf" target="_blank">FedRAMP Package Access Request Form [PDF - 278KB]</a> and if the requestor is not a federal employee they must also complete the associated Non-Disclosure Agreement for the FedRAMP Authorized CSO, conduct a package review and risk analysis, understand and implement customer responsibilities, issue an ATO and send ATO letters to <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>, and perform continuous monitoring responsibilities.

            <p>NIST SP 800-37 describes the ATO and ATU as very similar in that they are the mechanisms for documenting and accepting risk of the Information Systems, and approving the use of the system by the agency. ATUs are typically used for shared systems, but still documents accepting risk and approving use, based on an external security assessment. FedRAMP accepts both ATOs and ATUs. However, in order for FedRAMP to accept ATUs, there must be at least one ATO on file for a CSO.</p>

            <p>Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) play a critical role in the authorization process by assessing the security of a Cloud Service Offering. As independent third parties, they perform initial and periodic assessments of cloud systems to ensure they meet FedRAMP requirements. The federal government uses 3PAO assessments as the basis for making informed, risk-based authorization decisions for the use of cloud products and services. 3PAOs are accredited by the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA).

            <p class="margin-top-0">In addition to the critical role that 3PAOs play in assessing cloud services, some Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) use 3PAOs as consultants to help prepare security documentation or provide security advisory services.

            <p>Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs) can obtain an ATO or P-ATO one of two ways&#58;</p>
            <p class="margin-top-0"><strong>Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) through the Joint Authorization Board (JAB):</strong> A JAB P-ATO is an initial approval of the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) authorization package by the JAB that any federal agency can leverage to grant an ATO for the use of the cloud service within their agency. The JAB consists of the Chief Information Officers (CIOs) from the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the General Services Administration (GSA), supported by designated technical representatives (TRs) from their respective member organizations. The JAB P-ATO is called a provisional ATO because there is no risk accepted by JAB CIOs. The JAB P-ATO signifies all three JAB Agencies reviewed the security package and deemed it acceptable for the federal community.  In turn, Agencies review the JAB P-ATO and the associated security package and clear it for their Agencies’ use. In doing so, the agency issues their own authorization to use the product. Additionally, the JAB will conduct continuous monitoring for systems that have earned a P-ATO.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-0"><strong>Agency Authority to Operate (ATO): </strong>As part of the Agency Authorization process, a CSP works directly with the agency partner who reviews the cloud service’s security package. After completing a security assessment, the agency Authorizing Official (or their designee) can issue an ATO. </p>

If they have not been approved, they should remain in the “Open POA&#38;M Items” tab until approved. Then, at least annually during assessment, the false positives should be evaluated for continued false positive status.
