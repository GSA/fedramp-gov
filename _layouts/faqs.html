            <p>There is a shared security responsibility model when using cloud products. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and agencies (customers) both assume important security roles and responsibilities to ensure data is protected within cloud environments. CSPs are required to submit a Control Implementation Summary (CIS) workbook as an attachment to the System Secruity Plan (SSP). The CIS workbook identifies security controls that the CSP is responsible for implementing, security controls that the agency (customer) is responsible for implementing, security controls where there is a shared CSP/agency responsibility, and security controls that are inherited from an underlying FedRAMP Authorized Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). The CIS workbook also includes a Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) worksheet tab. CSPs must use the CRM to describe the specific elements of each control where the responsibility lies with the customer. Further details are also provided within the CSP’s SSP.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-0">FedRAMP provides two CIS Workbook templates: one for Low and Moderate systems and one for High systems. Both are available on FedRAMP.gov’s <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/documents-templates/" >Documents &amp; Templates</a> page.</p>

The <strong>FedRAMP Authorized</strong> designation indicates FedRAMP requirements are being met and a CSO’s security package is available for agency reuse.

          <div id="fa-initial-agency-partner" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
            <p>An Initial Agency Partner or initial authorizing agency refers to the <strong>first</strong> agency to grant an Authority to Operate (ATO) using FedRAMP standards and baselines for the Cloud Service Offering (CSO). Some stakeholders use the term "Agency Sponsor.” FedRAMP does not recognize the concept of an agency sponsor because the ATO granted by the initial authorizing agency is not a government-wide risk acceptance. As described in FedRAMP's <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Reusing_Authorizations_for_Cloud_Products_Quick_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">Reuse Quick Guide</a>, OMB Circular A-130 requires agencies to individually authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk. Each agency that wishes to use the CSO will conduct its own risk review of the authorization package and grant its own ATO.</p>

          </h4>
          <div id="fa-additional-effort" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
            <p>It depends on the quality of the authorization package. Because the initial authorizing agency is the first agency to review the authorization package, the process for getting to an informed risk-based decision may take longer and require more effort if there are aspects of the authorization package that are unclear, incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-0">The FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) provides guidance to Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Third Party Assessors (3PAOs) on how to deliver a high quality authorization package, but if the agency team is unable to determine the actual security posture of the Cloud Service Offering (CSO) due to poor quality, the agency will provide feedback. The feedback may result in modifications to the package deliverables and/or additional testing, and additional review cycles.

          </h4>
          <div id="fa-performing-conmon" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
            <p>No.  It is not the initial authorizing agency’s responsibility to conduct ConMon oversight on behalf of all other agencies. OMB Circular A-130 requires federal agencies to implement the Risk Management Framework (RMF) described in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf" target="_blank">NIST SP 800-37</a>. The RMF process includes a Monitor step. The purpose of this step is to maintain ongoing situational awareness about the security posture of the system in support of risk management decisions. Each agency that issues an ATO or ATU for a cloud offering must review the Cloud Service Provider’s (CSP’s) ConMon activities to ensure the security posture remains sufficient for its own use and supports an ongoing authorization. This includes reviewing the monthly Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), approving deviation requests and significant change requests, and reviewing the results of the annual assessment. The FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) encourages CSPs who have more than one customer agency to streamline the ConMon process and potentially minimize duplicative efforts in a way that helps each agency still perform their due diligence related to ConMon. The PMO developed a recommended Collaborative ConMon approach. This approach is described in the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Guide_for_Multi-Agency_Continuous_Monitoring.pdf" target="_blank">Guide for Multi-Agency Continuous Monitoring</a>. Collaborative ConMon benefits agencies by allowing them to share responsibility for ConMon oversight, and it benefits the CSP by creating a central forum for addressing questions and achieving consensus related to deviation requests, significant change requests and the annual assessment - versus having to coordinate with each agency separately.

            <p class="margin-top-0">In the scenario where a dedicated private cloud application is deployed on top of another cloud (IaaS, PaaS) versus within a federal facility, the agency should use the FedRAMP process and baselines to authorize the cloud service. However, the FedRAMP PMO does not review packages for private clouds, grant a FedRAMP Authorized designation, or list them on the Marketplace because the concept of “reuse” does not apply.

          <div id="csp-MFA-tool" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
            <p>To achieve a FedRAMP Ready designation, a CSO’s MFA solution must comply with NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63B, which requires the use of FIPS 140 validated encryption for MFA tools. While agencies may accept risk by allowing a CSP to work through POA&M actions to achieve compliance with NIST SP 800-63B requirements, a Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) has no authorizing official to accept and approve risk for open POA&Ms. A FedRAMP Ready designation indicates to agencies that a cloud service can be authorized without significant risk or delay due to noncompliance. The use of FIPS 140 validated cryptographic modules, where encryption is required, is a federal mandate, as indicated in the RAR template. This applies to MFA tools as well.</p>
            <p> The FedRAMP PMO has provided additional resources below that apply to all MFA tools, where required (authenticators and verifiers).</p>
	   <p> <strong>MFA resources:</strong>
		    <li>1. The NSA published a paper last year,<a href="https://media.defense.gov/2020/Sep/22/2002502665/-1/-1/0/CSI_MULTIFACTOR_AUTHENTICATION_SOLUTIONS_UOO17091520.PDF" target="_blank">Selecting Secure Multi-factor Authentication Solutions</a>, addressing popular MFA offerings and their status on meeting NIST requirements; CSPs may find this helpful to assist in identifying FIPS 140 validated MFA solutions. As indicated, this is not a FedRAMP developed document and FedRAMP does not control the currency of the information.</li>
		   <li>2. There are two notable exceptions to the FIPS 140 requirement for authenticators in SP 800-63. These are:</li>
		   <ul class="red-bullets margin-top-0">
			<li>On low baseline systems, FIPS 140 validated crypto modules are only required for MFA verifiers, not authenticators.</li>
			<li>On Moderate baseline systems, user-provided (“bring-your-own”) authenticators are exempt from having to meet FIPS 140 requirements, particularly in the government-to-public use case.</li>
			   </ul>
		  <li>3. NIST SP 800-63 is a complex set of documents that should be reviewed by any  organization implementing MFA for a government system. In addition to the base standards document, NIST provides a <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/" target="_blank">FAQ and implementation resources</a>.</li>

            <p>3PAOs play a critical role in the authorization process by assessing the security of a Cloud Service Offering (CSO). As independent third parties, they perform initial and periodic assessments of cloud systems to ensure they meet FedRAMP requirements. The federal government uses 3PAO assessments as the basis for making informed, risk-based authorization decisions for the use of cloud products and services. 3PAOs are accredited by the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA). A list of FedRAMP recognized 3PAOs can be found on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/assessors?sort=assessorName" target="_blank">FedRAMP Marketplace under the “Assessors” tab</a>.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-0">In addition to the critical role that 3PAOs play in assessing cloud services, some Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) use 3PAOs as consultants to help prepare security documentation or provide security advisory services.

            <p class="margin-top-0"><strong>P-ATO through the Joint Authorization Board (JAB):</strong> a JAB P-ATO is an initial approval of the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) authorization package by the JAB that any federal agency can leverage to grant an ATO for the use of the cloud service within their agency. The JAB consists of the Chief Information Officers (CIOs) from the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the General Services Administration (GSA), supported by designated technical representatives (TRs) from their respective member organizations. The JAB P-ATO is called a provisional ATO because there is no risk accepted by JAB CIOs. The JAB P-ATO signifies all three JAB agencies reviewed the security package and deemed it acceptable for the federal community. In turn, agencies review the JAB P-ATO and the associated security package and clear it for their agency’s use. In doing so, the agency issues their own authorization to use the product. Additionally, the JAB will conduct continuous monitoring for systems that have earned a P-ATO.</p>

FedRAMP does specify data location requirements in the High baseline as part of control SA-9 (5); however, FedRAMP does not provide or specify data location requirements for the other baselines. Beyond FedRAMP, other federal statutes, regulations, or policies may apply. </p>

The product must actually be submitted for testing and validated through the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) to be considered FIPS-validated.

It is worth noting that some FIPS 140-2 validated modules may not support cryptographic algorithms to allow for TLS 1.3.

		  <p>Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities.

		  <p>Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, of where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding Security Assessment Reports (SAR) Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.</p>
		<p>During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.</p>
