							<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) periodically releases Emergency Directives (ED) and Binding Operational Directives (BOD). CISA and FedRAMP work collaboratively to determine the appropriate scope and response to all ED and BODs as it pertains to FedRAMP. FedRAMP releases guidance to Cloud Services Providers (CSP) regarding all actions that must be taken by CSPs in response to CISA EDs and BODs.</p>

							<p>Although CISA's BOD 19-02, Vulnerability Remediation Requirements for Internet-Accessible Systems, identifies requirements for remediation of Critical vulnerabilities within 15 calendar days of initial detection, FedRAMP does not currently differentiate between Critical and High vulnerabilities. That is, Critical vulnerabilities are treated as High and must be remediated or mitigated within 30 days of discovery. Authorizing Agencies can impose stricter remediation timeframes, such as 15 days for Critical vulnerabilities. This would be considered an agency-specific requirement and should be communicated to the CSP early in the authorization process.</p>

						<div id="conmon-ato-governed" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
							<p>Each agency that grants an ATO for a cloud service is responsible for ensuring that the CSP fulfills its responsibilities to perform continuous monitoring. It is the responsibility of all leveraging Agencies to review continuous monitoring deliverables from CSPs that have an Agency ATO (as well as to review the continuous monitoring artifacts for those that leveraged a P-ATO issued by the JAB).</p>

							<p>The CSP should work with Agencies to determine the best method to share continuous monitoring deliverables, which could be centralized across multiple Agencies. If Agencies have similar continuous monitoring requirements, it may be possible to develop a group of agency representatives to review continuous monitoring artifacts for a particular cloud service offering. See the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Guide_for_Multi-Agency_Continuous_Monitoring.pdf">FedRAMP Guide for Multi-Agency Continuous Monitoring</a> for additional guidance. </p>

							<p>In accordance with FISMA, only the head of an agency or appointed designee, the Authorizing Official (AO), can make the risk-based determination to use IT systems. FedRAMP cannot make decisions for Federal Agencies or accept risk on their behalf. The JAB authorization process helps to establish an initial review and approval that Agencies can leverage during their own authorization process.</p>

							<p>With some cloud service offerings, the JAB reviews the risk posture of cloud systems and provides provisional authorizations (P-ATOs) based on the security package. Once a package has been granted a P-ATO, a P-ATO letter is created.</p>

							<p>The Agency AO can then leverage a P-ATO, or other Agency ATO, including all supporting documentation, when making a risk-based decision to grant an Agency ATO. Each agency that is considering using the system should review the P-ATO/ATO letter as well as the package itself before deciding whether or not to use the system. </p>

If a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is hosted on a FedRAMP-authorized IaaS, the SaaS vendor would need to have a separate FedRAMP authorization. The IaaS authorization would remain as-is and then the SaaS would leverage/re-use the IaaS authorization and applicable security controls (for the IaaS portion of requirements). If a SaaS or PaaS is leveraging a non-FedRAMP authorized infrastructure, then the entire FedRAMP stack would need to be authorized together.</p>

							<p>There are two types of FedRAMP authorizations for cloud services:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) through the Joint Authorization Board (JAB)</li>
								<li>Agency Authority to Operate (ATO)</li>
							</ul>

							<h5>P-ATO Process:</h5>

							<p>A FedRAMP P-ATO is an initial approval of the CSP authorization package by the JAB that any Federal Agency can leverage to grant an ATO for the use of the cloud service within their agency. The JAB consists of the Chief Information Officers (CIOs) from DOD, DHS, and GSA, supported by designated technical representatives (TRs) from their respective member organizations. A P-ATO means that the JAB has reviewed the cloud service’s authorization package and provided a provisional approval for Agencies to leverage when granting an ATO for a cloud system. Additionally, the JAB will conduct Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) on behalf of Agencies for systems that have earned a P-ATO. </p>

							<h5>Agency ATO Process:</h5>

							<p>As part of the Agency Authorization process, a CSP works directly with the agency partner who reviews the cloud service’s security package. After completing a security assessment, the agency Authorizing Official (or their designee) can issue an ATO. For more information about these two authorization paths, please visit our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/agency-authorization">Get Authorized page</a>.</p>

Use of the FedRAMP logo in conjunction with qualified products or services (i.e. an approved 3PAO) does not require approval. The FedRAMP PMO must approve any major educational or promotional campaigns that feature the FedRAMP logo prior to use.

						<div id="csp-3pao" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
						
							<p>For the JAB authorization process, the Third Party Assessor must be a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO. For the agency authorization process, a 3PAO is recommended, but not required. A CSP’s agency partner may choose to use their Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) organization to assess the system. If an agency chooses to use their own IV&V team, they must submit an attestation regarding the team’s independence, and the IV&V team must use FedRAMP templates for the assessment and follow all FedRAMP requirements.</p>


							<p>3PAOs are accredited by the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA). A list of 3PAOs can be found on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/assessors?sort=assessorName">FedRAMP Marketplace under the “Assessors” tab</a>.</p>

						<p>Commercial entities wishing to become tenants within a FedRAMP Public Cloud Service that hosts both Federal and Commercial customers should work directly with the Cloud Service Provider for all necessary security documentation and cloud services. At a minimum, this should include the customer responsibilities; however, many service providers provide additional services, such as partially filled out SSP templates and other services that can onboard tenants rapidly. The FedRAMP PMO does not provide any access to commercial customers of the cloud service.</p>

							<p>The FedRAMP model of “do once, use many times” removes a barrier to entry for small businesses to work with Federal Agencies. Instead of CSPs having to expend resources for security authorizations with each agency customer, they can complete a FedRAMP authorization once and reuse with subsequent agency customers – saving both time and money.

						<p>No, using a FedRAMP Authorized infrastructure does not automatically make your service FedRAMP compliant.

							<p>In order to become a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO, the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) must perform an initial assessment of the 3PAO and provide an initial assessment recommendation to FedRAMP for approval. In order for a 3PAO to maintain its FedRAMP recognition, A2LA must perform a favorable annual review (desk audit) and a full reassessment (on-site audit) every two years. </p>

							<p>A2LA assessments ensure 3PAOs meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 17020 (as revised) and FedRAMP-specific knowledge requirements. More information on becoming an accredited 3PAO may be found on the A2LA website.</p>

							<p>Generally, JAB systems can only leverage External Services that are also FedRAMP Authorized at the same security baseline as the leveraging service. High Baseline systems should only leverage other FedRAMP JAB systems Authorized at the High Baseline. Moderate JAB systems should only leverage Moderate or High Baseline JAB External Systems. There may be flexibility with FedRAMP agency systems, though. The Agency Authorization Official (AO) may be willing to accept the risk associated with permitting External Systems that are not yet FedRAMP Authorized. </p>

							<p>3PAOs should identify the External Systems that are leveraged, but not authorized, as a finding and list it among “Remaining Risks” for the system.</p>
