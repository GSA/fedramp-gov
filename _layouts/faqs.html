            <p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that promotes the adoption of secure cloud services across the federal government by providing a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP empowers agencies to use modern cloud technologies, with an emphasis on security and protection of federal information.

The CIS/CRM workbook identifies security controls that the CSP is responsible for implementing, security controls that the customer is responsible for implementing, security controls where there is a shared CSP/customer  responsibility, and security controls that are inherited from an underlying FedRAMP Authorized Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). CSPs use the CRM to describe the specific elements of each control where the responsibility lies with the customer.</p>

            <p>An Initial Agency Partner or initial authorizing agency refers to the <strong>first</strong> agency to grant an Authority to Operate (ATO) using FedRAMP standards and baselines for the Cloud Service Offering (CSO). Some stakeholders use the term "Agency Sponsor.” FedRAMP does not recognize the concept of an agency sponsor because the ATO granted by the initial authorizing agency is not a government-wide risk acceptance. As described in <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Reusing_Authorizations_for_Cloud_Products_Quick_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">FedRAMP's Reuse Quick Guide</a>, OMB Circular A-130 requires agencies to individually authorize the operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk.

          <div id="fa-additional-effort" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
            <p>It depends on the quality of the authorization package. Because the initial authorizing agency is the first agency to review the authorization package, the process for getting to an informed risk-based decision may take longer and require more effort if there are aspects of the authorization package that are unclear, incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-0">The FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) provides guidance to Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and third party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) on how to deliver a high quality authorization package, but if the agency team is unable to determine the actual security posture of the cloud service offering (CSO) due to poor quality, the agency will provide feedback. The feedback may result in modifications to the package deliverables and/or additional testing, and additional review cycles.

          <div id="fa-performing-conmon" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
            <p>No. It is not the initial authorizing agency’s responsibility to conduct ConMon oversight on behalf of all other agencies. OMB Circular A-130 requires federal agencies to implement the Risk Management Framework (RMF) described in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf" target="_blank">NIST SP 800-37</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-sm"></i>. The RMF process includes a Monitor step. The purpose of this step is to maintain ongoing situational awareness about the security posture of the system in support of risk management decisions. Each agency that issues an ATO or ATU for a cloud offering must review the cloud service provider’s (CSP’s) ConMon activities to ensure the security posture remains sufficient for its own use and supports an ongoing authorization. This includes reviewing the monthly Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), approving deviation requests and significant change requests, and reviewing the results of the annual assessment. With the release of the FedRAMP Rev 5 baselines, security control CA-7 requires CSPs with more than one customer agency to implement collaborative ConMon. This approach is intended to streamline the ConMon process and potentially minimize duplicative efforts in a way that helps each agency still perform their due diligence related to ConMon. The PMO developed a recommended Collaborative ConMon approach, which is described in the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Collaborative_ConMon_Quick_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">FedRAMP Collaborative ConMon Quick Guide</a>. Collaborative ConMon benefits agencies by allowing them to share responsibility for ConMon oversight, and it benefits the CSP by creating a central forum for addressing questions and achieving consensus related to deviation requests, significant change requests and the annual assessment - versus having to coordinate with each agency separately.</p>

If a new ATO is obtained during this period, the CSO will regain its FedRAMP Authorized designation. If an ATO is not achieved within 12 months, the CSP may maintain its FedRAMP Ready designation by working with a FedRAMP-recognized Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) to complete a Readiness Assessment of its service offering. Alternatively, the CSP may transition to In Process by fulfilling the requirements described in FedRAMP’s Marketplace guidance.

            <p>3PAOs play a critical role in the authorization process by assessing the security of a cloud service offering (CSO). As independent third parties, they perform initial and periodic assessments of cloud systems to ensure they meet FedRAMP requirements. The federal government uses 3PAO assessments as the basis for making informed, risk-based authorization decisions for the use of cloud products and services. 3PAOs are accredited by the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA). A list of FedRAMP recognized 3PAOs can be found on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/assessors?sort=assessorName" target="_blank">FedRAMP Marketplace under the “Assessors” tab</a>.</p>
            <p class="margin-top-0">In addition to the critical role that 3PAOs play in assessing cloud services, some cloud service providers (CSPs) use 3PAOs as consultants to help prepare security documentation or provide security advisory services.

While agencies may accept risk by allowing a CSP to work through POA&M actions to achieve compliance with NIST SP 800-63B requirements, a Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) has no authorizing official to accept and approve risk for open POA&Ms. A FedRAMP Ready designation indicates to agencies that a cloud service can be authorized without significant risk or delay due to noncompliance.

			<li>On Moderate baseline systems, user-provided (“bring-your-own”) authenticators are exempt from having to meet FIPS 140 requirements, particularly in the government-to-public use case. Note: This exemption does not apply to CSP personnel. The FIPS 140 requirement still applies to CSP employee and contractor authenticators.</li>

		  <p>For initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, of where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding Security Assessment Reports (SAR) Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s plan of action and milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.</p>

		  <p>CSPs can assess the baseline risk factors defined in NIST SP 800-161, Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations, Appendix E Table E-1. CSPs will need to work with their vendors to gain access to the necessary documentation that the CSP can review to determine whether the vendor is in alignment with NIST 800-171 or equivalent framework. That may be an internal assessment performed by the supplier, a third-party, or in support of a framework such as PCI or ISO/IEC 27001 and others.</p>

If there is a single solution or there are multiple technologies that use automated mechanisms to identify the location and type of data and protect the organizational and privacy data, that meets the intent of the control. The solution should be documented in the SSP.
