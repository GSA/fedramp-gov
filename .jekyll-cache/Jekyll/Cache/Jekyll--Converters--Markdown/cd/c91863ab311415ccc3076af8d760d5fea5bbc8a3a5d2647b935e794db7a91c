I"L<p>FedRAMP is excited to announce that we just reached a huge milestone: 300 FedRAMP Authorized Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs)!  Federal agencies now have access to more CSOs that they need to do their jobs effectively and efficiently, from remote access and scalability, to collaboration and efficiency, just to name a few. As more CSOs are authorized, federal agencies have more options for cloud services, which can lead to increased competition and better pricing. This milestone is also significant because it highlights the continued growth and maturity of the FedRAMP program.</p>
