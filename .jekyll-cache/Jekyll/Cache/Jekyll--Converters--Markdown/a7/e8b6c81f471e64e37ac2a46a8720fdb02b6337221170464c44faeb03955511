I"g<p>FedRAMP recognizes the importance of the FedRAMP Authorization Boundary Guidance in supporting the development of security package documentation for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).</p>

<p>The FedRAMP Authorization Boundary Guidance was initially created, in collaboration with both internal and external stakeholders and the Joint Authorization Board (JAB), to help CSPs understand how to accurately describe and illustrate their Cloud Service Offering’s (CSO’s) authorization boundary. This latest update provides CSPs with more detail and clarity on how to describe and illustrate their CSO’s authorization boundary, data flow diagrams, and network interconnections.</p>

<p><strong>FedRAMP is currently adjudicating all feedback from the public comment period. The FedRAMP PMO will release communications when the updated guidance is finalized.</strong></p>
