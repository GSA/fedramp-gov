I"À<p>NIST <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank">released version 1.0.0 of OSCAL</a>Â <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-sm"></i>. The FedRAMP PMO, in collaboration with NIST, is working to standardize authorization packages and streamline their review with a common machine-readable language, also known as the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL).</p>

<h3>Benefits of OSCAL</h3>
<p>With OSCAL, activities associated with preparing, authorizing, and reusing services will require less time and resources. As a result of a machine-readable authorization package, we anticipate several impacts, such as:</p>

<h5 style="margin-left:20px">Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)</h5>
<p class="margin-top-0" style="margin-left:20px">Will be able to create their System Security Plans (SSPs) more rapidly and accurately, validating much of their content before submission to the government for review.</p>

<h5 style="margin-left:20px">Agencies</h5>
<p class="margin-top-0" style="margin-left:20px">Will be able to expedite their reviews of the FedRAMP security authorization packages.</p>

<h5 style="margin-left:20px">Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)</h5>
<p class="margin-top-0" style="margin-left:20px">Will be able to automate the planning, execution, and reporting of cloud assessment activities.</p>

<h3>OSCAL 1.0.0 includes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Updated stable versions of catalog and profile models which provide a structured representation of control catalogs and baselines or overlays.</li>
  <li>Updated stable version of the System Security Plan model which provides a structured representation of a systemâ€™s control-based implementation.</li>
  <li>Updated stable version of the component definition model which provides a stand-alone structured representation of the controls that are supported in a given implementation of a hardware, software, service, policy, process, procedure, or compliance artifact (e.g., FIPS 140-2 validation).</li>
  <li>Updated stable versions of the assessment plan, assessment results, plan of action and milestones (POA&amp;M) models, which support the structured representation of information used for planning for and documenting the results of an information system assessment or continuous monitoring activity.</li>
  <li>Updated tools to convert between OSCAL, XML, and JSON formats, and to upconvert content from previous releases to RC2.</li>
</ul>
