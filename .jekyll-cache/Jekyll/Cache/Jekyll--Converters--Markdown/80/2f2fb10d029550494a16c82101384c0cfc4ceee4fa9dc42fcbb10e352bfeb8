I"ˆ	<p>The FedRAMP PMO, in collaboration with NIST, is working to digitize the authorization package through the development of a common machine-readable language, also known as the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL).</p>

<p>With OSCAL, activities associated with preparing, authorizing, and reusing cloud products and services will require less time and resources. As a result of a machine-readable authorization package, we anticipate several impacts, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)</strong> will be able to create their System Security Plans (SSPs) more rapidly and accurately, validating much of their content before submission to the government for review.</li>
  <li><strong>Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)</strong> will be able to automate the planning, execution, and reporting of cloud assessment activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Agencies</strong> will be able to expedite their reviews of the FedRAMP security authorization packages.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>OSCAL Short Video</strong></p>

<p>The FedRAMP PMO developed a short video that discusses high-level OSCAL goals, applications, and how to use the FedRAMP OSCAL SSP template and other resources.</p>
