I"¶<p>In an effort to strengthen the qualifications of third party assessment organizations (3PAOs), the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) recently released an updated version of the R311 â€” the policy document that outlines the requirements for all FedRAMP recognized third party assessment organizations (3PAOs) and organizations seeking A2LA accreditation to be recognized by FedRAMP.</p>

<p>A2LAâ€™s memorandum highlights the significant changes to the R311 and encourages assessors to read the updates in their entirety. As mentioned in the memorandum, the majority of the requirements are in effect immediately and will be assessed during each 3PAOâ€™s upcoming A2LA assessment. To learn more about the changes, please visit <a href="https://a2la.qualtraxcloud.com/ShowDocument.aspx?ID=5621">A2LAâ€™s Website.</a></p>
