<p>The FedRAMP PMO is asking for a few minutes of your time. Surveys give us an opportunity to gather your valuable feedback in order to improve both FedRAMP as a whole and your experience working with the PMO. In previous years, FedRAMP released its own survey to our stakeholders. This year we are leveraging the annual GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Customer Survey to gather your responses around all aspects of your interactions with FedRAMP.</p>
