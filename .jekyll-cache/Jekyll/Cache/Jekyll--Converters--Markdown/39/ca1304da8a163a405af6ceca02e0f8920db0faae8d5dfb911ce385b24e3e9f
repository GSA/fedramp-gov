I"i<p>One of FedRAMP’s core value propositions is facilitating government-wide reuse of security packages for Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs). Today, over 180 cloud products are FedRAMP Authorized and are available on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> for government-wide reuse. Collectively, these products have been reused over 1,500 times.</p>

<p>To make this possible, FedRAMP eliminates duplicative efforts by providing a common security framework. Agencies review their security requirements against a standardized baseline. A Cloud Service Provider (CSP) goes through the authorization process once, and after achieving FedRAMP Authorization for their CSO, the security package can be reused by any federal agency.</p>

<p>FedRAMP developed a <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/Reusing_Authorizations_for_Cloud_Products_Quick_Guide.pdf"> quick guide for agencies</a> that outlines how to reuse a security package for a FedRAMP Authorized CSO. When reusing FedRAMP security packages, agencies should keep in mind the following best practices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> to determine which cloud products are FedRAMP Authorized</li>
  <li>Understand and implement customer responsibilities</li>
  <li>Send a copy of your ATO letter for FedRAMP Authorized services to <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a></li>
</ul>

<p>FedRAMP Authorized products provide the intrinsic benefits of the cloud - remote access, scalability, collaboration efficiency, and many more - that help the federal government achieve its mission and deliver services to the public, and are critical to many agencies’ IT modernization efforts.</p>
