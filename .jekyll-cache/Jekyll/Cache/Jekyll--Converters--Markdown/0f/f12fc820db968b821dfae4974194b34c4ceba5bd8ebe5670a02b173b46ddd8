I"ò<p>FedRAMP updated its <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Marketplace_Designations_for_Cloud_Service_Providers.pdf">Marketplace Designations for Cloud Service Providers</a> (CSPs) guidance document to clarify requirements for achieving a FedRAMP Marketplace designation. This document defines each of FedRAMPâ€™s Marketplace designations and lists the criteria a Cloud Service Offering (CSO) must meet to achieve and maintain each designation.</p>

<p><strong>Updates to this document include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Clarifies requirements for achieving the In Process designation.</li>
  <li>Outlines a new provision for CSOs when federal agencies are no longer using the offering.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/products?sort=productName">FedRAMP Marketplace</a>?</strong></p>

<p>The Marketplace is the authoritative source for CSOs that have achieved a FedRAMP Marketplace designation. Federal agencies can use the FedRAMP Marketplace to research which CSOs have achieved a FedRAMP Ready, In Process, or Authorized status.</p>

<p>If you have any questions as you read through the updated document, please reach out to <a href="mailto:info@FedRAMP.gov">info@FedRAMP.gov</a>.</p>
