I"Š<p>NIST control SC-7 for Boundary Protection relies in large part on subnetworks (subnets), specifically subnet segmentation around â€œpublicly accessibleâ€ components. This white paper, entitled  <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_subnets_white_paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">â€œSubnets White Paperâ€</a>, provides guidance on how NIST control SC-7 will be evaluated in documentation submitted for a FedRAMP authorization. Cloud Service Providers and Third Party Assessment Organizations can reference this white paper when developing documentation and for information on following topics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What are subnets and how should they be segmented,</li>
  <li>What constitutes â€œpublicly accessibleâ€, and</li>
  <li>FedRAMPs upcoming process to develop future guidance when applying this control to software defined networks.</li>
</ol>
