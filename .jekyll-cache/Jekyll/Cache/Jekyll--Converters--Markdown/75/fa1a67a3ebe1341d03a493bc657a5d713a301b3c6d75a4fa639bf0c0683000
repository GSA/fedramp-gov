I"<p>The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), in conjunction with FedRAMP, decided to continue to offer a remote participation option for the Baltimore Cyber Range (BCR) Technical Proficiency activity for Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAOs).</p>

<p>In early 2021, BCR developed the capability to assess 3PAO assessor teams in a remote and decentralized format. This provided an alternate option to teams travelling to BCR for an on-site activity or for BCR staff to travel to a co-located 3PAO assessor team and served as an opportunity to navigate travel challenges associated with the pandemic. Given the feedback BCR and A2LA received, BCR will continue to offer this as a standard type of assessment option for 3PAO assessor teams.</p>

<p>As a result, A2LA has recently released an updated version of the R346-Specific Requirements - Baltimore Cyber Range Technical Proficiency Activity Information, that includes this option for 3PAOs to take BCR proficiency activity remotely. To learn more about this change, please read <a href="https://a2la.org/new-release-update-r346-baltimore-cyber-range-requirements/">A2LAâ€™s memorandum</a> on their Website.</p>
