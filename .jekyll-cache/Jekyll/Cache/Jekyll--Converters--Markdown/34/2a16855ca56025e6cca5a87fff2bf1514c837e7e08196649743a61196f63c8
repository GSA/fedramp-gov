I"×<p>The FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board has approved the FedRAMP Rev. 5 baselines! The FedRAMP baselines were updated to correspond with the National Institute of Standards and Technologyâ€™s (NIST) <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Rev. 5 Catalog of Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations</a> and <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53b/final" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SP 800-53B Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations</a>.</p>

<p>Outlined below are the released documents with a supporting high level summary:</p>

<h4><a href="https://fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Baselines_Rev5_Transition_Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Transition Plan</a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Provides guidance to assist Cloud Service Providers (CSP), Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs), Federal Agencies in transitioning to NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, and to the new FedRAMP requirements</li>
  <li>Categorizes CSPs based on their stage in the FedRAMP authorization process and defines date-based transition periods for each category</li>
  <li>Assists CSPs with identifying the scope of the Rev. 5 controls that require testing by an assessor</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="https://fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Security_Controls_Baseline.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rev. 5 Baselines</a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Aligns security controls more closely with NIST</li>
  <li>Adds significant guidance for many controls</li>
  <li>Privacy controls, and any other control outside of the FedRAMP baselines, remain at the agencyâ€™s discretion</li>
  <li>Program Management (PM) controls remain an agency responsibility and are therefore not included in the baselines</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>During the approval process, FedRAMP has been working diligently to complete updates based on public comments to the Rev. 5 baselines and supporting documentation. The FedRAMP <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/open-security-controls-assessment-language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL)</a> baseline profiles and resolve profile catalogs will be released within the next few weeks along with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>System Security Plan (SSP)</li>
  <li>Security Assessment Plan (SAP)</li>
  <li>Security Assessment Report (SAR)</li>
  <li>Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M) for High, Moderate, Low, and Li-SaaS baselines</li>
  <li>Corresponding FedRAMP OSCAL SSP, SAP, SAR, and POA&amp;M guides</li>
</ul>

<p>FedRAMP will also provide training and educational forums specific to the Rev. 5 updates and the transition process this summer.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we ask that CSPs and other stakeholders review the CSP Transition Plan and make plans to address the updated templates in the coming weeks.</p>
