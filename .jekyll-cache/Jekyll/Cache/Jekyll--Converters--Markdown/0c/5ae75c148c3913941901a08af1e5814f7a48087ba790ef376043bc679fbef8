I"š<p>FedRAMP updated the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-POAM-Template.xlsm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&amp;M) template</a> to include two new columns. The additional columns were added at the behest of agency partners to help them track Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 findings, and the associated Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).</p>

<h4>Whatâ€™s New?</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Column â€˜ACâ€™:</strong> Titled as the â€˜Binding Operational Directive 22-01 Due Dateâ€™  should be used to track the due date of any BOD 22-01 vulnerability as the due date appears in the CISA <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog</a>. If the POA&amp;M line item is not associated with any BOD 22-01 vulnerability, this cell should be left blank.</li>
  <li><strong>Column â€˜ADâ€™:</strong> Titled as â€˜CVEâ€™ - should now be used to track the CVEâ€™s associated with the vulnerabilities listed on that POA&amp;M line item (if applicable). If there are no CVEâ€™s associated with that vulnerability, it should be left blank.</li>
</ul>

<p>These columns can be found at the end of the current template headers in Row Five.</p>

<p>For more guidance around the purpose and requirements of the POA&amp;M, please review the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_POAM_Template_Completion_Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP Plan of Actions and Milestones Completion Guide</a>.</p>
