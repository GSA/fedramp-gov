I"<p>FedRAMP would like to remind federal agencies to authorize their Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs) and submit the associated Authority to Operate (ATO) letter to the FedRAMP PMO. Agency authorization of CSOs is required to maintain compliance with <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/OMB/circulars/a130/a130revised.pdf">OMB Circular A-130</a> and submission of the corresponding ATO to FedRAMP helps support a critical component of FedRAMPâ€™s security package reuse model.</p>
