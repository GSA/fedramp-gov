I"<p>At the end of 2020, National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) released Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Rev. 5 catalog of security and privacy controls and SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations. Since, FedRAMP has been administering the following approach to implement the baseline updates:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1 [COMPLETED]:</strong> Develop draft FedRAMP Baselines from NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Updates</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2 [COMPLETED]:</strong> Release draft FedRAMP Baselines for Public Comment</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3 [IN PROGRESS]:</strong> Update FedRAMP Baselines and Documentation Based on Public Comments</li>
  <li><strong>Step 4 [UPCOMING]:</strong> Release Final Rev5 FedRAMP Baseline Documentation Updates and CSP Implementation Plan</li>
</ul>

<p>As of April 1, 2022, the public comment period has ended and the FedRAMP PMO has moved into Step 3 of the process. FedRAMP will share updates with our government partners and industry stakeholders as we proceed with this transition.</p>

<h4>What's Next?</h4>
<p>The final version of FedRAMP’s updated Rev. 5 baselines (including OSCAL versions), associated documentation and templates, an implementation guide, and compliance timeline will be published once all steps have been completed. FedRAMP will also provide training and educational forums specific to the Rev. 5 updates and transition process.</p>

<p>Please contact <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a> if you have any questions about these pending updates, and check out our prior blog announcements for additional information on FedRAMP’s transition to Rev. 5.</p>
