I"é<p>FedRAMP has updated the Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) Guide and templates (linked below) in order to provide enhanced guidance for Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs).</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-High-RAR-Template.docx">FedRAMP High Readiness Assessment Report Template</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Moderate-RAR-Template.docx">FedRAMP Moderate Readiness Assessment Report Template</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/3PAO_Readiness_Assessment_Report_Guide.pdf">FedRAMP 3PAO Readiness Assessment Report Guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The updates to both of the RAR templates and the guide aim to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Streamline template sections/tables to simplify and reduce duplication and complexity</li>
  <li>Clarify requirements and instructions based on feedback from 3PAOs and CSPs</li>
  <li>Align the RAR with current FedRAMP guidance and requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>The intent of the RAR is for a 3PAO to document a Cloud Service Offeringâ€™s (CSO) management, technical, and operational capabilities and attest a CSOâ€™s readiness for the FedRAMP authorization process. By completing a RAR, a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is able to understand if their CSO has the key capabilities to obtain a FedRAMP authorization. While the CSP should review the RAR for accuracy, the 3PAO has ownership of the RAR and is fully responsible for its content.</p>
