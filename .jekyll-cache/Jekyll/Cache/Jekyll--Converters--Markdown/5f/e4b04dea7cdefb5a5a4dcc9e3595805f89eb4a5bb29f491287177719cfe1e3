I"K<p>We’re excited to announce the release of FedRAMP’s updated <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Penetration_Test_Guidance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Penetration Test Guidance</a>!</p>

<p>These updates were made to address the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape. Revisions include updated guidance around existing and new threats as well as addressing attack vectors so they’re in alignment with current best practices.</p>

<p>The revision process included the following initiatives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gathered input from Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) via surveys and direct conversations.</li>
  <li>Solicited input from penetration testing subject matter experts, both within the government and 3PAOs.</li>
  <li>Conducted two Technical Exchange Meetings (TEMs) with 3PAOs and Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Technical Reviewer(TR)-recommended SMEs,</li>
  <li>Engaged a JAB member with a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification to review the updated guidance and provide us with feedback.            <br />
