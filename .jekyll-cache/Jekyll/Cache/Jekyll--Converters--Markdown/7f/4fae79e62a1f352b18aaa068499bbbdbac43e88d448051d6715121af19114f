I"§<p>We receive thousands of questions through <a href="mailto:info@fedramp.gov">info@fedramp.gov</a>, and one of the most popular topics is the FedRAMP Marketplace and which cloud capabilities are <em><strong>FedRAMP Ready, In Process, or Authorized</strong></em>. With over 220 industry partners engaged with the program, the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products?sort=productName">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> is a one-stop-shop in providing visibility into the FedRAMP community. The Marketplace serves as a searchable and sortable database of Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs), aiding Agencies in the process of researching and identifying secure cloud capabilities that are available for government-wide use. It also lists the accredited auditors that can perform the FedRAMP assessment, known as Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs). With over 250,000 visits annually, the Marketplace is a valuable source of real-time information for our customers.</p>

<p>Given the importance of the Marketplace, we want to ensure the information about each CSO is established in easy-to-understand guidance. The new <a href="/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Marketplace_Designations_for_Cloud_Service_Providers.pdf">Marketplace Guidance</a> outlines the various FedRAMP designations for CSOs and provides details for industry and Agencies in achieving and maintaining FedRAMP status on the Marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>Key takeaways from the Marketplace Guidance:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Supersedes previous guidance document, the ‚ÄúAgency Authorization: Requirements for In Process Designation,‚Äù as part of a larger effort to streamline and consolidate our documents.</li>
  <li>Explains the process for achieving and maintaining all three of our Marketplace designations.</li>
