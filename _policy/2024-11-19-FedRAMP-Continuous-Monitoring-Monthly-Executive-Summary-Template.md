This form provides FedRAMP and Agency Authorizing Officials (AOs) with an executive summary of the monthly continuous monitoring submission from a CSP. It includes references to all files that should be reviewed with that submission. The ConMon Executive Summary is updated and submitted with every monthly continuous monitoring submission by the CSP.
