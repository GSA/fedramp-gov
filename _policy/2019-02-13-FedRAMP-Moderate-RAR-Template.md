The FedRAMP Moderate RAR Template and its underlying assessment are intended to enable FedRAMP to reach a FedRAMP Ready decision for a specific CSP’s system based on organizational processes and the security capabilities of the system. FedRAMP grants a FedRAMP Ready designation when the information in this report template indicates the CSP is likely to achieve a JAB P-ATO or Agency ATO for the system.
