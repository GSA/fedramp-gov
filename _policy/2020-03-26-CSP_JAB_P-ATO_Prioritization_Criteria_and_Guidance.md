The purpose of this document is to outline the criteria by which CSPs are prioritized to work with the JAB toward a P-ATO, the JAB prioritization process, and the Business Case requirements for FedRAMP Connect. We ask that CSPs review this document in its entirety before beginning the FedRAMP Connect process.
