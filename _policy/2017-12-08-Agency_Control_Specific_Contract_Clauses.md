FedRAMP security control baselines specify control parameter requirements and organizational parameters specific to the provider’s control implementation. Since certain controls may be required to govern Agency user interaction, control organizational parameters may need to be included in the task order and specified. The FedRAMP PMO suggests that agencies review the FedRAMP security control baseline, and that agencies do not contractually specify parameters for controls in the FedRAMP baseline, except from the perspective of a consumer’s implementation of a control.
