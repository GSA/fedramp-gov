This document replaces the P-ATO Management and Revocation Guide and explains the actions FedRAMP will take when a CSP fails to maintain an adequate risk management program. It lays out the escalation processes and procedures as well as minimum mandatory escalation actions FedRAMP will take when a CSP fails to meet the requirements of the P-ATO. It also specifically addresses FedRAMP P-ATOs maintained by the JAB and enables FedRAMP to provide effective oversight of the CSP Continuous Monitoring programs.
