Ryan Hoesing joined the team in December 2016 after serving in an executive administrative role for senior leadership at the General Services Administration (GSA). Ryan began his service at GSA in 2014 and since then has quickly learned how to navigate many of the bureaucratic administrative hurdles that are a part of working in the federal space.  

Ryan is part of a team that helps manage customer engagement between Agencies and Cloud Service Providers. Ryan leads the charge in making sure that authorization timelines are met through FedRAMP’s  ever-changing kanban boards. In doing so, Ryan helps the FedRAMP Agency Authorization team push the adoption of secure cloud technologies across the Federal Government.

In previous roles, Ryan has demonstrated proven leadership skills in strategy and business development that he now uses in his current role with the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO). Ryan joined GSA after serving as a business economic development advisor in the United States Peace Corps. Since, Ryan has taken classes in front-end web development that have helped fuel his interest in IoTs and cloud security.

Ryan holds an B.A. in Business Administration from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and is an avid Nebraska football fan. He continues his education on all things cloud and is currently working towards a M.S. in Cybersecurity Management and Policy.
