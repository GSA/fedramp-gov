Pete brings decades of experience in the development and adoption of technology services in both the private and public sector. He joined federal service in 2019 with the US Digital Service where he became deeply familiar with the complex web of laws, regulations, policies and standards that make deploying technology in government entirely different from the private sector. Prior to public service, he led engineering teams that delivered internet based services at various size software companies. 

Outside of work, Pete likes to explore and has traveled across much of the world by motorcycle or other vehicles - he once turned down a reality tv show because it would limit his ability to just go where the road takes him.
