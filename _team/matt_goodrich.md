Matt Goodrich is the Director for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) within the General Services Administration (GSA).

Matt has worked on FedRAMP as part of the Federal Cloud Computing Initiative since August of 2009. In this role, he manages the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) and sets the overall direction of the program. As a mandatory government-wide initiative, FedRAMP is one of the leading cloud computing security programs paving the way for cloud adoption and ensuring the security of cloud computing solutions used by the US Government.

Matt has focused his career on removing the barriers to cloud adoption across the Federal Government. He was part of the team that created the first government-wide cloud procurement vehicle through Apps.gov as well as the IaaS and cloud email BPAs at GSA. He authored two of the integral documents in the Administration’s push for cloud adoption. First, during his tenure at OMB, he was the key author of Security Authorization of Information Systems in Cloud Computing Environments, which created the FedRAMP program. Second, he co-wrote Creating Effective Cloud Computing Contracts for the Federal Government: Best Practices for Acquiring IT as a Service which provides guidance to Agencies in how to procure cloud services and was published through the CIO and CAO Councils.

Matt began his career in the Federal Government as a Presidential Management Fellow (PMF) in 2009. Matt has a BBA in Computer Information Systems from the University of Miami (FL) and a Juris Doctor from the University of Denver.
