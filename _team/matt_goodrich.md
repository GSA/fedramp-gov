As of August 27, 2018, Matt Goodrich, previously FedRAMP Director, was named the Acting Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Products and Programs (OPP) - the GSA organization within which FedRAMP resides.

Matt has worked on FedRAMP as part of the Federal Cloud Computing Initiative since August of 2009, and brings a wealth of experience and deep connections within OPP to this new leadership role. Matt cultivated, grew, and transformed FedRAMP for the past 6 years by engaging with key partners within GSA, across the USG, the White House, industry, and the Hill. Additionally, Matt recently represented OPP during the strategic assessment of GSA’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS) and provided valuable insights into how OPP operates and how the office can continue to align strongly with 18F, the Presidential Innovation Fellows, and the Centers of Excellence.

Matt has focused his career on removing the barriers to cloud adoption across the Federal Government. He was part of the team that created the first government-wide cloud procurement vehicle through Apps.gov as well as the IaaS and cloud email BPAs at GSA. He authored two of the integral documents in the Administration’s push for cloud adoption. First, during his tenure at OMB, he was the key author of Security Authorization of Information Systems in Cloud Computing Environments, which created the FedRAMP program. Second, he co-wrote Creating Effective Cloud Computing Contracts for the Federal Government: Best Practices for Acquiring IT as a Service which provides guidance to Agencies in how to procure cloud services and was published through the CIO and CAO Councils.

Matt began his career in the Federal Government as a Presidential Management Fellow (PMF) in 2009. Matt has a B.B.A. in Computer Information Systems from the University of Miami (FL) and a J.D. from the University of Denver.
