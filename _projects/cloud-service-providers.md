FedRAMP provides standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services used by the US government. Because its goal is to protect US citizen data in the cloud, it is government’s most rigorous security compliance framework.

Before FedRAMP, vendors were faced with different requirements for each Agency they worked with, which meant they had to prepare authorization packages for each one. FedRAMP implemented standard security baselines and processes to provide both an initial authorization of a cloud service and a mechanism for that security package to be reused across the federal government. This saves time, money, and effort for both Agencies and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). 

CSPs whose services are currently being used by the federal government or are interested in selling their cloud service to the federal government should obtain a FedRAMP authorization, per OMB memorandum. 

In addition to FedRAMP’s stamp of security approval, FedRAMP authorization provides CSPs the benefit of: 
* Listing in the FedRAMP Marketplace, increasing visibility of their product across government
* Strengthened government confidence in the CSP’s cloud services
* Long-term reduction in time and money spent on federal security compliance through FedRAMP’s model of “do once, use many times”

## FedRAMP Authorization: A CSP’s Perspective 
A few drivers for CSPs to consider when deciding if a FedRAMP authorization is right for them (in addition to the OMB mandate) include: 

* Interest in selling their cloud service to the federal government
* Current federal customers requesting a FedRAMP authorization for their cloud service
* Desire to expand their business and market their service as FedRAMP authorized
If a CSP thinks FedRAMP might be right for their cloud service, there are a few steps they can take to get started:
* Review the documents, templates, and other resources available on the FedRAMP website
* Ensure that the service offering has implemented the necessary FedRAMP security controls in accordance with appropriate data impact level as described in FIPS PUB 199 (i.e. High, Moderate, Low, Low-Impact SaaS)
* Complete FedRAMP Training, including the mandatory training: FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP) Required Documents (200-A)

<h3>Pre-Authorization: </h3>
<p>Prior to beginning the authorization process, CSPs should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete a FedRAMP CSP Information Form </li>
<li>Articulate and document their federal demand, either through identification of potential demand in the form of RFIs/RFQs, proven demand in form of RFPs and active contracts, or previous federal experience
<ul>
   <li>Note: In all cases, CSPs should be able to identify Agency POCs as sponsors.</li></ul></li>
<li>Identify and establish partnership with a FedRAMP-approved Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO)
   <ul><li>Note: For a current listing of approved 3PAOs, visit the FedRAMP Marketplace.</li></ul></li>
<li>Contact the FedRAMP PMO about beginning an authorization through info@fedramp.gov</li>
</ul>

<h3>During Authorization</h3>
<p>CSPs that have demonstrated sufficient demand, or have identified one or more partnering Agencies for their services, must then select between pursuing the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) provisional authorization or an initial Agency authorization. For more information about JAB and Agency authorizations, please visit [enter link to ‘Get Authorized web page].</p>

<p>At a high level, the authorization process includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Package Development:</strong> This includes an Authorization Kick-Off meeting with representatives from the CSP, partnering Agency, 3PAO, and FedRAMP PMO. The CSP then completes the System Security Plan (SSP) and attachments and the 3PAO develops the Security Assessment Plan (SAP).</li>
<li><strong>Assessment:</strong> The 3PAO completes testing and submits the System Assessment Report (SAR). The CSP then creates the Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) based on the findings from testing.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization:</strong> The authorizing party (either an Agency or the JAB) reviews the security package and decides whether or not to accept the risk posture associated with the system. If accepted, the authorizing party grants an authorization for the CSP’s service offering (either an Agency Authority to Operate (ATO) or a JAB Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO)). An ATO letter is submitted to the FedRAMP PMO, and the CSP is listed in the FedRAMP Marketplace as a FedRAMP authorized vendor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Post Authorization</h3>
<p>Once the service offering is authorized, the CSP must provide monthly continuous monitoring deliverables to the Agency (or Agencies) that are using the service. The monthly continuous monitoring deliverables should be reviewed by each Agency, but do not need to be shared with the FedRAMP PMO.</p>
</section>

<h3>“Do Once, Use Many Times”</h3>
<p>FedRAMP was designed so that once a cloud service offering has been authorized once, Agencies can review the existing authorization package and grant ATOs for their organizations to use the service. This prevents CSPs and Agencies from duplicating work that has already been done as part of the initial authorization, saving time and money.</p>

<p>Once a service offering has been authorized, it is listed in the FedRAMP Marketplace. The FedRAMP PMO encourages Agencies to use the Marketplace to find services that meet their needs, knowing that any service listed in the Marketplace meets federal security requirements and has already been authorized.</p>
